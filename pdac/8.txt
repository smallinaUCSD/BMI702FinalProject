Assessment    Impression: 71 y.o. female with metastatic pancreatic  cancer as summarized above.    Plan:  1. Metastatic pancreatic cancer. Responding to gem abraxane with stable disease but neuropathy.  Further reduced abraxane today.   Recheck neuropathy in 2 weeks.     CT scan on next end of September 22.new dperession  : remeron started today.     3. Nausea/vomiting  - GOO stented and stable for now.
