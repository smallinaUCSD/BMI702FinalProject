HPI:  ***** ***** is a 36 y.o. female with a recently diagnosed hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative node positive right breast cancer. She is scheduled to proceed to surgery on 11/05/17 and is here to discuss treatment options and recent imaging findings.    ***** underwent a mammogram at an outside facility (*****) on 09/24/17 which showed an 1.8 cm irregular hyperdense mass in the right breast. There was no mammographic evidence of malignancy in left breast. US revealed a 1.7 cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the 11:00 position along with 2 prominent axillary LNs. US guided core biopsy of the breast on 09/30/17 revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (ER+ (80-90%), PR+ (80-90%), HER2 by IHC & FISH negative;  Ki67% 20-30%) Histologic grading was not reported.     She sought a surgical opinion at ***** and saw Dr. ***** on 10/02/17. An MRI of breast performed on 10/03/17 at the ***** showed a 2.2 cm mass in the upper central right breast and a 0.4 cm anterior satellite lesion. There were also findings suspicious for additional ductal disease, disease within the nipple and prominent right axillary LNs.    There was some delay in the outside MRI becoming available for Dr. *****'s review but eventually the enlarged lymph nodes were noted to be suspicious and an axillary LN biopsy was scheduled. In the meantime, the patient was seen by Dr. ***** in ***** ***** and the patient underwent an egg harvest. This resulted in only 3 fertilized embryos, so ***** has interest in trying another egg harvest at some point.    ***** underwent an axillary FNA on 10/28/17 and the node was positive for metastatic cancer. PET/CT performed on 10/31/17 revealed a hypermetabolic right breast mass (2.1 x 1.6 cm) and an enlarged right axillary lymph node. There were other subcentimeter, asymmetric right subpectoral lymph nodes with low-level uptake. There was also a hyperdense 0.7 cm falx lesion that could be a partially calcified 
 falcine meningioma or dural metastasis. She underwent an MRI brain today to exclude a dural metastasis. The MRI showed a 0.5 cm right parafalcine dural-based mass most likely a meningioma. I spoke with the radiologist to find out if this lesion was amenable to biopsy and the neuroradiologist thought a biopsy could be difficult and morbid and their level of suspicion for this lesion being metastatic disease is low.    She is scheduled to undergo a partial mastectomy and ALND with Dr ***** on 11/05/17. She is here for planning of subsequent steps of treatment and to discuss her treatment options. She is also concerned about whether she needs to take time off from work during her treatment especially during chemotherapy.

CURRENT THERAPY AND DATE INITIATED: None TECHNIQUE:   Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours.  Following intravenous administration of 9.1 mCi of F18-FDG, a contrast enhanced, diagnostic CT was performed. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 60 minutes after FDG injection.  PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data.  PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted.  Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images.  Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 93 mg/dL.

Inferior and anterior to this there is an 8 mm calcified falcine meningioma. Other: No metastases. Non-oncologic findings: Brain:   Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.  No mass effect.  While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated. Neck:

Breast cancer: ***** is scheduled to undergo surgery on 11/05/17. We reviewed her imaging and pathology reports to date. I explained that because of her young age and lymph node involvement, it is very likely that she will need adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to hormonal therapy. However, because her cancer is hormone receptor positive or locally advanced tumors  and we are not certain of the tumor size and number of lymph nodes involved, it is not certain that she needs an anthracycline containing regimen. Although we often consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with node positive or locally advanced breast cancers, Dr. ***** feels he can offer ***** breast conserving surgery without neoadjuvant treatment and we can then know more definitively the tumor size, extent of nodal involvement and possibly a Mammaprint on her tumor.  I explained to her that the final decision about chemotherapy can be made after surgery when we however we discussed several options and trials which may be appropriate for her.     I reviewed the meaning of the Mammaprint result and described the data published by Vant Veer in the NEJM in 2002 and the validation data published in the JNCI in 2006. I explained additional validation data for use of Mammaprint as both a prognostic and predictive tool. I also explained the 
 published results form the Mindact trial which demonstrated that patients who have clinical higher risk cancers based on traditional measures including tumor size, grade and lymph node status, but whose tumors have a Mammaprint Low Risk profile have an excellent prognosis at 5 years even in the absence of chemotherapy, and chemotherapy offers very little benefit for these patients.     We briefly discussed choice of chemotherapy and reviewed the data from the "Anthracyclines in Early Breast Cancer: The ABC Trials-USOR 06-090, NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132, and NSABP B-49 (NRG Oncology)" metaanalysis published by Joanne Blum in JCO in April 2017.   In these three adjuvant trials, women were randomized TC for six cycles or to a standard TaxAC regimen. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). A hazard ratio (HR) that exceeded 1.18 for TC6 versus TaxAC was predefined as inferiority for TC6. With a median follow up of 3.3 years, the HR for TC6 versus TaxAC was 1.202 which triggered early reporting for futility and supported that TC x 6 was not non-inferior to TaxAC. The 4-year IDFS was 88.2% for TC6 and was 90.7% for TaxAC (P = .04). However, upon review of particular subsets including patients who were ER+ and node negative, there was no statistically significant difference in outcomes between TC x 6 and TaxAC, and in the ER+ patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes, the difference in IDFS was very modest. Therefore, if ***** is Mammaprint High Risk and needs chemotherapy but has fewer than 3 positive nodes, she may not gain substantial benefit from an anthracycline containing regimen.    We discussed the toxicities associated with Taxotere and Cytoxan including increased risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, and possibility of ovarian failure. I explained that taxanes are associated with development of neuropathy which is most often transient and rarely *****. I also explained that we are 
 proponents of scalp cooling including the Dignicap and Penguin Cold Cap which can help preserve hair during chemotherapy.    We briefly discussed participation in clinical trial trials of CDK 4/6 inhibitors such as the PALLAS and JPBE.     Lastly, ***** and her husband asked about when she would begin treatment with hormonal therapy. I explained that she would start this after radiation and we will discuss selection of hormonal therapy and side effects at a later visit.    2. Fertility preservation: ***** is interested in another round of egg harvesting since she has only three fertilized embryos. She is open to surrogacy if needed in the future and will be eligible for financial support from her employer. I am supportive of her decision to undergo egg harvest for the second time after completion of surgery.     FU after surgery.    I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.
