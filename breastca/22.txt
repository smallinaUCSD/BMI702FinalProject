*****  60 yo F    Chief complaint: Patient with early stage breast cancer here to discuss neoadjuvant therapy    History of Present Illness:  ***** ***** is a 60 y.o. female with a recently diagnosed right sided invasive  spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma breast cancer.    The patient's history began in October 2016 when she felt a mass in her right breast, she sought care at ***** ***** with a breast surgeon 11/30/16, who felt a 3cm mass at 9:00 6cm FN and in the office an US showed a complex cystic mass, she performed a CNB in her clinic    11/30/16: US guided CNB performed: malignant spindle cell carcinoma of the breast, ER neg 0%, PR neg 0%, Her2 FISH neg (ratio 1.2)  12/17/16 Bilateral diagnostic mammo:  L: benign, R: 2.7 cm focal rounded nodular density in the lateral aspect of the right breast, BIRADS 0  12/17/16: US R breast: rounded 2.8 x 1.9 cm area of decreased echogenicity with somewhat variegated internal echotexture. The overall appearance is consistent with a probable postbiopsy hematoma  12/17/16: CXR - nml  12/30/16:MRI breasts performed in *****: irregular mass with heterogenous enhancement and central necrosis (with clip) in 9:00 6cmFN measures 2.9x2.5x3.3. Prominent nodes in Right axillary tail   Left breast with lobulated mass in upper outer quadrant, 7mm    01/15/17: Genetics at ***** - 126 InVitae panel sent  01/15/17: Visit with Dr *****  01/18/17: MRI at *****: 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.6 cm round mass with irregular, slightly spiculated margins and rim enhancement in the outer central right breast, middle depth. Approximately 15 mm anterior to the index mass there is a 12 mm irregular mass enhancing mass. In addition there is another similar 8 mm enhancing mass located 18 mm anterosuperior to the index lesion at the 10 o'clock position.  Taken together the index right breast mass and associated satellite masses span approximately 5.5 cm in AP extent.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Known biopsy proven 
 malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).Recommendations:  1) Right outer central breast index malignancy measures 3.5 cm. Two small satellite masses are located 12-15 mm anterior/superior to the index mass.  2) Mildly prominent right axillary lymph nodes. Recommend further evaluation with ultrasound.    02/02/17: PETCT 1. Heterogenous hypermetabolic right breast mass consistent with patient's known breast carcinoma. Associated minimally hypermetabolic non-enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific and better evaluated on same day breast MRI. 2. Indeterminate right adrenal nodule measuring up to 2.3 cm. Further evaluation can be obtained with adrenal protocol CT/MRI.     02/02/17: UCSF review of outside path agreed spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma, did not repeat markers, no grade    02/03/17: R US with research cores and placement of clip, FNA axillary node with clip    02/03/17: FNA negative    02/11/17 MRI guided CNB for extent of disease      Cr 1.0 in 2011      The patient has been referred to discuss neoadjuvant treatment.

Based on the tumor size and multifocal nature, the patient was referred to discuss neoadjuvant chemotherapy.     We discussed that the metaplastic aspect of her cancer is rare and portends a more aggressive biology - therefore we strongly encouraged neoadjuvant therapy and consideration of the trial with the potential benefit of receiving a promising experimental agent.    We discussed with ***** in great detail the natural history and treatment of locally advanced triple negative breast cancer.  We informed the patient that she currently has no evidence of metastatic disease and that we can therefore treat her with curative intent.  We reviewed the pathology report and discussed the multimodality approach of breast cancer treatment.  The patient understands that treatment will include chemotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy, and potentially radiation therapy depending on her surgical choice and final pathology.  We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to assess response to treatment, and to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery.     We discussed the chemotherapy regimens that would be recommended as the standard of care, and discussed how these regimens would be different in the context of the I-SPY2 clinical trial.  We explained that in the context of her higher risk triple 
 negative metaplastic disease we would typically recommend that she receive either 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks.  We explained that in the context of I-SPY2, patients are randomized to a control or to receive an experimental agent in addition to paclitaxel.   If she is randomized to an experimental therapy, then we will discuss that drug in more detail at that time.    The patient is very interested in the I-SPY2 clinical trial and has already consented. She has done the MRI, research biopsy, and Echo, mammaprint is pending and the echo looks good.  Her labs revealed an elevated creatinine and Alk phos, and she may have been dehydrated.  We will check these again    We explained that if her tumor has a Mammaprint low risk profile, she would not be eligible to participate in the therapeutic portion of the trial, but given the metaplastic aspect I am fairly certain it will be high risk.  If for some reason it is not, we will need to re-assess the diagnosis of metaplastic breast cancer and we could present her case to our multidisciplinary tumor Board.    We specifically discussed the typical and less common side-effects associated with AC/T, such as fatigue, neuropathy, skin and nail changes, myalgias, alopecia, myelosuppression, nausea.      She will benefit from a Medi-port, which was explained to her and to which she has agreed.  We will arrange for chemo teaching session, and while we could start therapy as early as next week the patient is needing a little more time to arrange things with work and would prefer to start the first week in February which we will plan for.     The patient asked about her genetic predisposition to this cancer - and we will discuss this further with her when we have the results of the gene panel that has been sent.     Pt visit was 55 min, with >50% of the time spent on counseling.
