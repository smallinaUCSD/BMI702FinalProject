ID: ***** ***** is a 55 y.o. ***** with a recent diagnosis of early stage breast cancer, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    Date of Service: 10/21/17    HPI: The patient has not had screening mammograms.  She felt a lump in her left breast in February 2017.  She did not immediately seek care, but did start an evaluation (through ***** *****) in June 2017.  Her work-up and treatment to date are as follows:    February 2017 Felt lump in her left breast    06/14/17 Diagnostic mammogram: irregular spiculated mass in left upper outer quadrant corresponding to palpable abnormality; irregular mass in posterior, inferior, subareolar region of right breast  Targeted left breast ultrasound: irregular hypoechoic mass (1.8 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm) at 1:30 position, 10 cm from nipple  Targeted right breast ultrasound: lobulated hypoechoic mass (1 x 1.1 x 1.2 cm) at 8:00 position, 6 cm from nipple    06/17/17 US-guided left breast core biopsy at 8:00 position, 6 cm from nipple: 0.75 cm grade 3 IDC with ER+ 100%, PR+ 75%, HER2- (IHC 1+; FISH ratio 1.1)   US-guided right breast core biopsy at 1:30 position, 10 cm from nipple: 0.6 cm grade 1 IDC with ER+ 100%, PR+ 75%, HER2+ (IHC 2+; FISH ratio 2.0 with HER2 copy # per cell 4.4); intermediate nuclear grade DCIS     07/02/17 Breast MRI: right - irregular homgeneously enhancing mass (2.3 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm) corresponding to right breast index mass (at 8:00 position, 13 cm from nipple); left - irregular homgeneously enhancing mass (2.2 x 3.3 x 2.6 cm) corresponding to left breast index mass (at 2:00 position, 10 cm from nipple); multiple prominent low level 1 left axillary LN with thickened cortex, asymmetric compared to right    07/11/17 US-guided left axillary LN core biopsy (3:00 position, 19 cm from nipple): multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma (largest 1.5 mm) with tumor cells present in adipose tissue adjacent to fibrous tissue, unclear whether this 
 represents extracapsular invasion; HER2- (IHC 1+; FISH ratio 1.2)    08/13/17 Left breast partial mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection: 6.2 cm grade 3 IDC; ER+ 99%, PR+ >95%, HER2- (1+; FISH ratio 1.0); suspicion for LVI, margins negative, focal high grade DCIS within tumor; 0/8 LN+ (0.7 mm micrometastasis with no extracapsular extension); MP high risk (-0.614)  Right breast partial mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection: 2.0 cm grade 1 IDC with ER+ 99%, PR+ 90%, HER2- (IHC 0; FISH ratio 1.5); 0/8 LN+; MP Low Risk (+0.321)  (Surgeon: Dr. ***** *****)    Presents to clinic with her husband and sister (*****).  She reports that she has felt a lot healthier since having her breast surgery.  She has some mld joint stiffness, in particular in her knees.      ***** has met with Dr. ***** ***** and Dr. ***** ***** who have both recommended adjuvant chemotherapy (she states that they have specifically recommended TC).  She states that when she saw Dr. ***** he recommended that her tumor (presumptively left) be sent for Oncotype.  She is not yet aware of a result.    She is concerned that the benefits of chemotherapy will not outweigh its long-term risks.

Assessment and Recommendations:  55 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer who should proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy in the context of clinically and genomically high risk disease in the left breast.       I discussed with 
 the patient in great detail the natural history and treatment of early stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer.  We reviewed the available imaging and pathology reports.  I noted that she had 2 breast cancers with very different features.  Specifically, she has a Stage III (T3N1) HR+/HER2- grade 3 IDC of the left breast (MP high risk -0.614) and a Stage I (T1cN0) HR+/HER2- grade 1 IDC of the right breast (MP low risk).    With regards to her left breast cancer, I noted the high clinical risk features, including tumor size, lymph node status, and grade.  I explained that with the above clinical characteristics, patients would historically be recommended chemotherapy. I then introduced the utility of genomic profiling of the tumor (with tools like MammaPrint and Oncotype) to predict recurrence risk and benefit from chemotherapy. I noted that in the MINDACT clinical trial all patients with both high clinical risk and high genomic risk were recommended chemotherapy and that patients with such characteristics have not been studied with randomization to receive or not receive chemotherapy.  I stated that the addition of chemotherapy was important to reduce distant recurrence risk and that I would expect that benefit to be an absolute reduction in DFS of ~8%.  Her tumor is apparently being assessed for Oncotype DX RS.  I stated that I have seen some discordance between these two tests, and that were she found to have intermediate or high risk disease with Oncotype I would still recommend chemotherapy, but if she had low risk disease it would be both unexpected and difficult to reconcile - I would want to discuss the result at that time.  I noted that TAILORx does not apply to her given her positive LN, even as a micrometastasis.    I stated that with regards to chemotherapy regimens, I would recommend TC x 4 cycles over AC/T in the context of the ABC clinical trials and that she had only 1 positive LN.  We discussed extensively the 
 typical SE associated with TC chemotherapy, including fatigue, myelosuppression, joint pain, myalgias, fluid retention, finger nail changes, alopecia, and cognitive dysfunction.    With regards to her right breast cancer, I noted the low clinical risk features, including tumor size, clear LN status, grade, and biomarker status.  I noted that chemotherapy would not be recommended for this tumor as it would not provide benefit.    I explained in the context of HR+/HER2- breast cancers, regardless of other therapy decisions, anti-estrogen therapy was the most important part of treatment her moving forward.  I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with HR+/HER2- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (AI), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an AI for at least 5 years and that this would not start until after chemotherapy, and radiation.    I stated she would need a DEXA to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week), which she does appear to currently achieve through daily walking.      Recommendations in Brief:  - docetaxel/cyclophosphamide x 4 cycles  - radiation  - AI therapy for at least 5 years  - consider adjuvant trial of a CDK4/6 inhibitor    I spent a total of 120 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 115 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options.
