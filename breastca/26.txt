She started pembrolizumab and abraxane on 03/11/19 and presents today for cycle 1 day 8.    Metastatic breast cancer  - axillary pain improved which is hopeful for early treatment 
 response  - Continue abraxane every week (continuous) and Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. Monitor TSH  - Due to poor peripheral access she will need a port, hopefully she can get it next week    Jugular clot  - restart xarelto, stop for port placement per IR    Colon cancer    Endometrial cancer    Nausea/GERD due to chemo  - Continue ativan and compazine prn. Allergic to zofran  - Rx prilosec 40mg qd    Peripheral neuropathy due to Taxane, new and mild  - Monitor    Mylagias due to Taxane  - Rx mag oxide 400mg qhs    Pain  - Continue work with pain mgmt  - Continue MS Contin 15mg BID, oxycodone prn, flexeril, and ativan  - continue stool softener to prevent opioid induced constipation    F/u 2 weeks then every 3 weeks      I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 45 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.
