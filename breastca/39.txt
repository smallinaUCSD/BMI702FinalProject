       .    The discussions today were based on the assumption that the review of outside records and pathology confirms the current diagnosis. All recommendation will be adjusted after final pathology diagnosis, review of path from her original tumor, FISH assessment and final size and lymph node involvement as well as the ultimate surgical approach.       Plan: Based on the tumor characteristics outline above, the patient a candidate for adjuvant therapy.      A HER2 targeting approach with a chemotherapy back bone. Options include an anthracycline followed by a taxane for 4 cycles each or with the current data preferable six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin. The latter has a reduced cardiac risk.
