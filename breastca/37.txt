HPI:  ***** ***** is a 32 y.o. female here for a discussion of treatment options for recently diagnosed left breast cancer. Her history is as follows:    ***** underwent genetic testing in early 2018 due to family history of breast cancer diagnosed around age 30. The Myriad myRisk panel identified a mutation in the ATM gene (c1109dup (p.Tyr370*) heterozygous). In December 2017, she palpated a left breast lump and presented to PCP. On 01/10/18, a left breast US at ***** ***** ***** demonstrated an irregularly marginated mass with internal vascularity at 5:00, 4-5cm from the nipple. On 01/12/18 left diagnostic mammogram at ***** ***** ***** found an irregular 15 mm mass at 5 o'clock, 5cm from the nipple.    On  01/24/18 an US-guided core biopsy of the left breast mass at ***** ***** ***** revealed a grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 8mm. The cancer is ER positive (>95%), PR positive (<5%), HER2 negative (by FISH), Ki67 44%.    On 02/06/18, an US of left axilla noted multiple lymph nodes, largest measuring 1.2 x 1.5 x 0.5cm and smallest 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4cm. The small node was echogenic throughout. The two slightly larger nodes showed normal hilar echogenicity with a hypoechoic rim. No architectural distortion was noted. On 02/14/18, an FNA of a left axillary lymph node was attempted in ***** and the path was benign. The report described a few benign mesenchymal cells admixed with lymphocytes and peripheral blood cell elements, and no malignant cells identified.    On 02/17/18, a diagnostic mammogram of right breast showed no evidence of malignancy. On 02/22/18, the patient came to ***** for a second opinion with Dr. *****.     She underwent bilateral breast MRI on 03/16/18. In the right breast, there is a 9 mm oval mass with smooth margins and dark internal septation in the upper outer right breast. Findings are classic for fibroadenoma. There was no abnormal areas of enhancement or 
 other MRI features of malignancy  on the right. In the LEFT breast, there is a 2.5 cm x 2.2 cm  x 2.3 cm oval mass with irregular margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the lower outer left breast. There is also at least two abnormal lymph nodes in the left axilla level I and I/II with cortical thickening, measuring up to 6 mm.     She was seen by Radiation Oncology at ***** yesterday who were not enthusiastic about offering this patient radiation based on her ATM mutation, and therefore recommended she proceed with mastectomy. She was seen in ***** today and Dr. ***** has recommended a repeat FNA of the left axilla.     Subsequent to the visit, the Mammaprint from her prior core biopsy came back as High Risk (-0.622)    History reviewed. No pertinent past medical history.

Comparison:  Prior examination dated 01/12/2018 was reviewed for comparison.    MRI Technique:  Bilateral 1.5T breast MRI 
 without and with contrast was performed with a dedicated breast coil using T1 and T2-weighted sequences including:  axial T2-weighted with fat saturation, high resolution T1 fat-suppressed 3D gradient echo pre-, and dynamic post-contrast sequences. Gadolinium based contrast was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.1 millimole per kilogram body weight without adverse reaction.    The study was processed with a Hologic Aegis Sentinelle system to optimize interpretation by generating multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in 3 dimensions using raw and generated subtracted images from the dynamic contrast enhanced data set.    MRI Findings:  This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates mild background enhancement.  The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat.    RIGHT Breast:  There is a 9 mm oval mass with smooth margins and dark internal septation in the upper outer right breast. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates slow initial rise and persistent enhancement kinetics.All findings classic for fibroadenoma.  No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified. Findings are best seen on post-contrast axial image #66 and sagittal image #603.    LEFT Breast:  There is a 2.5 cm (AP) x 2.2 cm (TV) x 2.3 cm (CC) oval mass with irregular margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the lower outer left breast. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. Findings are best seen on post-contrast axial image #87 and sagittal image #118.    Other: At least two abnormal lymph nodes in the left axilla level I and I/II with cortical thickening, measuring up to 6 mm. Findings are best seen on post-contrast axial images #24 and 55.    IMPRESSION:   Left breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Right breast: Benign (BI-RADS 2).    Recommendations:  1. Recommend continued 
 surgical/oncological management for knwon left breast malignancy.    Pathology results reviewed and discussed with the patient:    Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** is a 32 y.o. female ATM mutation carrier with a clinical T2NX ER+/PR-/HER2 negative left breast. Subsequent to our clinic visit, the patient underwent a second FNA of the left axillary LNs and it again showed no cancer. Because of her ATM mutation, radiation oncology has recommended that she proceed with mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery.     Despite the fact that the patient's tumor is Mammaprint High Risk and I will recommend chemotherapy, I explained to the patient that if she is truly node negative at the time of surgery, we will consider Taxotere and Cytoxan, whereas if she is node positive, she should get AC-Taxol. Therefore in order to make the most appropriate recommendation for chemotherapy, I favor her going to surgery first.    I explained my rationale for this recommendation in detail with the patient and her family and they voiced understanding. I began to explain the differences in the schedule and toxicities for various chemotherapies but will defer and comprehensive conversation until after surgery.    Because her breast cancer is estrogen receptor positive, she understands that she will receive at least five years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.   I briefly introduced the updated data from the SOFT and TEXT trials published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2017. Previously published data from this trial demonstrated that for patients who were premenopausal at diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence. The more recently published data from the SOFT trial shows the 8-year disease-free survival rate was 78.9% with tamoxifen alone, 83.2% with 
 tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 85.9% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.009 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression). Among the women with HER2 negative cancers who received chemotherapy, the 8-year rate of distant recurrence with exemestane plus ovarian suppression was lower than the rate with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression (by 7.0 percentage points in ***** and by 5.0 percentage points in TEXT).     W will have a more thorough discussion regarding choice of hormonal therapy after surgery as well.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan were reviewed  in detail.  Total face to face time: 60 minutes  Total counseling time: 45 minutes
