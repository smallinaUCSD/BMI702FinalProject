  SUBJECTIVE:  This is a very pleasant 65-year-old woman from ***** who was admitted to the hospital recently for pneumonia. An abdominal CT scan was done during her admission with an incidental finding of a pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration of the mass by EUS showed adenocarcinoma. She has subsequently had a pancreas protocol CT scan at *****. This did not show any evidence of metastatic disease. The mass in the distal necrotic body measures 3.9 cm and is localized to the pancreas. She's been seen by GI surgical oncology at *****.    She has been presented at tumor Board. Although she was  technically resectable, it was felt that she might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. She was started on gemcitabine and Abraxane. She only received 2 doses. With each administration, she developed severe adverse events including metabolic abnormalities with hypercalcemia and hyponatremia as well as total body aches. She was hospitalized each time. With that reason, we elected to stop preoperative therapy and refer her for surgery.    On 03/01/22, she underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. She was found to have a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 2 of 29 lymph nodes were positive. Her postoperative course was complicated by an infection and abscess which required ERCP for drainage.    We recommended postoperative gemcitabine and capecitabine using an alternate week schedule. She has had 2 cycles. She has tolerated it quite poorly. She's had mucositis and severe hand-foot syndrome with cracking and blistering. She has refused dose modification. She's also been falling and is not quite sure why. She does not describe vertigo but seemed to lose her balance. She has now using a walker.    She is very fatigued and sleeps about 12 hours in a 24 hour timeframe. She feels that she can only handle one event a day. She can walk a few blocks. She has 
 musculoskeletal pain and takes Tylenol, Flexeril and gabapentin. Fortunately, her appetite is good and she has not lost any weight. She is having one to 2 loose bowel movements a day.    She has had some genetic testing in the past and is known to carry an ATM VUS.

Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging       ASSESSMENT:  1. Adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas, status post distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with positive lymph nodes.  2. Psoriatic arthritis  3. Chronic asthma  4. Hypertension  5. history of MRSA infection x2  6. ECOG 2  7. Hyponatremia, etiology uncertain  8. Incidental PE   9. History of frequent falls associated with loss of balance  10. Severe hand-foot syndrome and mucositis secondary to chemotherapy          PLAN:    We will hold her chemotherapy until she has resolution of her hand-foot syndrome. We will then resume treatment, treating 
 5 days out of 7.    With regard to her falls, we have checked a CT of the head which is unremarkable. It is possible that the capecitabine is contributing to a balance disorder and we will see how she does off treatment. Fortunately, she is very agreeable to continuing to use a walker.    With regard to her PE, we will start her on Lovenox. We will also get Dopplers to understand whether she has DVT. She is very agreeable to doing Lovenox as she has done it before.  .  I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.    I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
