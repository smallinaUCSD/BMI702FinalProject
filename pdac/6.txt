SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 68-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction in early June 2020. She was hospitalized and treated conservatively. CT scan of the abdomen during her hospitalization showed a mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring 4.8 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm. She was also noted to have a complex cyst in her right adnexa. An EUS was done but biopsy was not attempted as there was a large blood vessel running through the mass. CT PET was done which showed that the mass in the tail of the pancreas was PET avid. The cystic pelvic mass was not PET avid.    She was then seen and evaluated by Dr. ***** at *****. A pancreas protocol CT scan was done which revealed extension of the mass to the posterior gastric wall as well as abutment and possible invasion of the left adrenal gland and occlusion of the splenic vein. Dr. ***** recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    We started her on standard schedule gemcitabine and Abraxane. She did not tolerate this well with neutropenia and we switched her to alternate week and she has tolerated that much better. She's now had 4 full cycles and returns for CT evaluation.    She is doing well. She has no cancer pain but take oxycodone for chronic back and shoulder pain. Appetite waxes and wanes but weight is stable. Denies symptoms of neuropathy. Energy level recovers after chemotherapy. She has a facil rash which has come on recently. It's tolerable.    She has been seen by Gyn Onc regarding the right adnexal mass. Assuming she does go to surgery, they would like to coordinate and remove this.    Germ line testing showed no pathologic variants. VUS seen in AXIN1, CTC1, ERCC4, MC1R.

We will repeat her imaging again in 8 weeks.    I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    I spent a total of 40 minutes in face-to-face time with the patient and in non-face-to-face activities conducted today 12/09/2020 directly related to this video visit, including reviewing records and tests, obtaining history and exam, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family or caregiver, documenting in the 
 medical record, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
