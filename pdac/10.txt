Evaluate for vascular involvement.     ***** TECHNIQUE *****:   CT images of the abdomen acquired without and with 130 mL Omnipaque 300 intravenous contrast. Multiphasic post-contrast images of the pancreas acquired.     CTDI: 10.15,10.88,12.69,12.68 mGy   DLP: 278.61,10.88,339.05,338.71 mGy-cm     COMPARISON: CT 03/16/2021     ***** FINDINGS *****:   5 mm right lower lobe nodule (image 16) is unchanged. There is a 2.8x 4.2 cm pancreatic neck hypodense mass with associated upstream pancreatic atrophy and pancreatic ductal dilatation.     This mass encompasses the superior mesenteric vein and main portal vein by <180 degrees. There is secondary moderate narrowing of these vessels which remain patent.      This mass encompasses the splenic vein near the confluence of the SMV by <180 degrees. There is severe secondary narrowing with the splenic vein remaining thinly patent.     This mass completely encompasses the gastroduodenal artery which remains fully patent.     The common and proper hepatic arteries are remote and from tumor. Superior mesenteric artery is also remote from tumor.     Hepatic steatosis. There is a 1.3 cm peripherally enhancing anterior right hepatic lobe lesion (image 57). There are additional subtle peripherally enhancing inferior right hepatic lobe lesions including a 7 mm lesion (image 74) and 5 mm lesion (image 70).     Bilateral adrenal thickening. The gallbladder and spleen are unremarkable.     The kidneys show symmetric enhancement. There is no hydronephrosis. No suspicious renal 
 mass.     Visualized loops of small and large bowel are not dilated. No suspicious abdominal nodes.     Aortic atherosclerosis. Normal abdominal aortic diameter (<3cm).      03/28/21  CT Chest  Normal chest CT.     Abdominal findings noted incidentally on described above, including ill-defined pancreatic mass.

Genomics  Pending STRATA    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 52 y.o. male with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer.    We discussed the following at today's visit:  I reviewed his imaging, pathology, and staging studies to date, explaining why the mainstay of treatment should consist of systemic therapy (rather than locoregional approaches, such as surgery or radiation), with the goal of achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but that treatment was not expected to be curative.      There are several possible chemotherapy options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on a patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference. The two current gold standards for front-line treatment, based on phase III data, include FOLFIRINOX (biweekly infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Given his age and performance status, FOLFIRINOX is a reasonable first choice standard of care option.    I also discussed potential clinical trials, notably our ongoing *****#*****: Precision Promise Platform Trial For Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer. Prior to this appointment, he reviewed the sample ICF for this study.      Today, he provided consent to proceed with screening procedures:  The UCSF Experimental Subjects Bill of rights has been 
 reviewed with the patient prior to signing the consent form and a copy has been given to the patient.  Alternative treatment to the patient's disease in lieu of clinical trial participation has been discussed with the patient.  Possible risks and possible side effects of participation in this clinical trial have been discussed.  The patient has been given opportunity to ask questions.  The patient has acknowledged that his/her questions were satisfactorily answered.  The requirement for the use of birth control while participating in this clinical trial was discussed.  The financial responsibilities while participating in this clinical trial were reviewed.  The patient has been given a copy of the signed consent form and signed HIPAA Authorization form.  A  Copy of the prohibited medication list has been reviewed with the  Patient.  The patient has been instructed to provide this list to any health care providers that may prescribe medication for the patient outside this clinical trials    # ?

This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, 
 counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.        I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.
