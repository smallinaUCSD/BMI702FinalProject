T14	SectionSkip 11262 12159	Findings: This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates moderate background enhancement. The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat. RIGHT Breast: There is a 34 x 20 x 25 mm irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the upper central to slightly outer right breast (axial image 59, sag image 413). Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. Susceptibility 
 artifact within the mass corresponds to the clip within the mass. No other abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified in the right breast. LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified. There is an enlarged right axillary lymph node with a cortex measuring up to 6 mm, likely corresponding to the recently sample axillary lymph node.
T15	SectionSkip 13232 13732	Findings: Targeted US of the right breast redemonstrated at 28 x 16 x 30 mm hypoechoic, irregular mass with indistinct margins, in the upper central right breast, at approximately 12 o'clock, 3 cm from nipple. Vascularity is not present. Findings are compatible with biopsy proven malignancy. Targeted US of the right axillary region demonstrated a lymph node with asymmetrically thickened cortex measuring up to 4mm maximum thickness, located at the 11 o'clock position, 
 9cm from the right nipple.

CLINICAL HISTORY:   32 years old Female with right breast carcinoma, evaluate for metastatic disease.  TECHNIQUE:   Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours.  Following intravenous administration of 8.1 mCi of F18-FDG, a contrast enhanced, diagnostic CT was performed. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 52 minutes after FDG injection.  PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data.  PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted.  Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images.  Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 94 mg/dL.  RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: ***** ***** received 2 exposure event(s) (excluding scout) during this CT study. The range of CTDIvol was 9.04 to 9.04 (mGy) and the TOTAL DLP was 923.24 (mGy-cm). The dose indicators for CT are the volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and the Dose Length Product (DLP), and are measured in units of mGy and mGy-cm, respectively. These indicators are not patient dose, but values generated from the CT scanner acquisition factors.  Individual patient doses calculated from these values will depend on patient size and can substantially underestimate or overestimate the actual dose.

FINDINGS: Brain:   Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.  No mass effect.  While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated. Neck:   No hypermetabolic neck masses or lymphadenopathy. Chest:   Lungs are clear. Prominent right axillary lymph node measures up to 9 mm a maximum SUV of 2.1 (series 4, image 66). Hypermetabolic right breast mass is better characterized on recent MRI breast and measures approximately 3.2 cm the maximum SUV of 8.4. Abdomen/Pelvis:   Unremarkable abdomino-pelvic organs.  No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal:   No metastatic disease.     1. Hypermetabolic breast mass better characterized on recent breast MRI. 2.

Core biopsy for clinical and research purposes. TECHNIQUE: Procedure was explained in detail to patient.  Risks (including risks of pain, infection, bleeding, non-recovery of targeted lesion, possible need for further intervention for diagnostic purposes), benefits, and alternatives discussed.  All questions were answered.  Written and verbal informed consent obtained.  This procedure immediately followed fine-needle aspiration.  Under sterile conditions, the lesion was re-identified at the 12 o'clock position, 3 cm from the nipple in the right breast. Following administration of a 1% Lidocaine with epinephrine, a small dermatotomy was made in the skin with a scalpel and a 14-16 gauge needle was placed under direct sonographic guidance with its tip at the lesion. Pre and post fire images demonstrated transgression of the needle through the lesion. A total of 8 biopsy samples were obtained (4 clinical, 4 research). Sterile Steri-Strips were placed at the incision site. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the department in satisfactory condition with instructions that if excessive bleeding or oozing should occur, she should contact her health care provider or visit an emergency room. She may obtain the results from her referring physician within 4 working days and if this is not possible, she may contact this department. 1.   Ultrasound guided core right breast biopsy for clinical and research purposes. 2.   Pathology pending. 3.   Fine needle aspiration of a right axillary lymph node was performed on the same date.

END OF IMPRESSION:     Mr Breast With And Without Contrast, Bilateral    Result Date: 04/15/2017  Exam Date: 04/15/2017 Exam(s): MR breast bilateral en + un Clinical History: 32-year-old woman with biopsy proven right breast cancer (outside hospital). Patient underwent repeat core biopsy here at ***** (with research cores) and fine needle aspiration of a suspicious right axillary node (results pending at the time of this MRI). Comparison: Prior examinations dated 04/11/2017 (ultrasound) and 03/19/2017 were reviewed for comparison. MRI Technique: Bilateral 1.5T breast MRI without and with contrast was performed with a dedicated breast coil using T1 and T2-weighted sequences including:  axial T2-weighted with fat saturation, high resolution T1 fat-suppressed 3D gradient echo pre-, and dynamic post-contrast sequences. Gadolinium based contrast was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.1 millimole per kilogram body weight without adverse reaction. The study was processed with a Hologic Aegis Sentinelle system to optimize interpretation by generating multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in 3 dimensions using raw and generated subtracted images from the dynamic contrast enhanced data set. MRI Findings: This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates moderate background enhancement. The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat. RIGHT Breast: There is a 34 x 20 x 25 mm irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the upper central to slightly outer right breast (axial image 59, sag image 413). Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. Susceptibility artifact within the mass corresponds to the clip within the mass. No other abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified in the right breast. LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified. There is an enlarged right axillary lymph node with a cortex measuring up to 6 mm, likely corresponding to the recently sample axillary lymph node. IMPRESSION: Right breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6). Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1). Recommendations: Recommend continued surgical and oncologic follow up of the known right breast cancer. Additionally, recommend correlation with cytology results of the recently sampled suspicious right axillary node. Recommend continued annual screening mammography for the left breast, according to American Cancer Society guidelines.
