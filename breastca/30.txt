Subjective:       Patient ID: ***** ***** ***** ***** 51 y.o. female.    HPI  ***** ***** is a 51 y.o. female with a biopsy proven left breast DCIS comes to our clinic today for a discussion of potential adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy. Ms. ***** presented on 12/05/2016 for routine screening mammography at which time indeterminate calcifications in the lower inner left breast were identified and a recommendation of additional imaging was made. On 12/11/2016 left breast diagnostic mammography was performed and showed a mammogram that was extremely dense with 3 mm group of amorphous punctate round calcifications in the left inner breast middle depth visible only on the cc view and these were new since 2011 and were deemed suspicious and a stereotactic core biopsy was recommended and performed on 12/27/2016. The pathology from this is appended below:    Left breast December 28/  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS  Left breast, stereotactic core needle biopsy:  1. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, cribriform and  micropapillary patterns, with focal necrosis; see comment.  2. Microcalcifications in association with ductal carcinoma in situ.  >90% estrogen receptor positive, Progesterone receptor pending.      Based on this finding a lumpectomy was recommended and performed on 01/29/2017 the pathology of which is appended below:  Laterality: Left.  - Tumor site: Lower inner quadrant.    - Position: 7 o'clock.  - Invasive tumor type: None.  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Present.  - DCIS nuclear grade: Intermediate.  - DCIS architectural patterns: Solid and cribriform.  - Necrosis in DCIS: None.  - Ductal carcinoma in situ size: DCIS present in 5 contiguous slices  (December 26), spanning 1.8 cm.  - Microcalcifications: None.  - Resection margins for DCIS:   For Part A:     - Posterior margin: Positive (tumor is at ink, on slide A8).  Additional margin submitted in part B is <0.1 from the new margin.    - 
 Anterior medial margin: Negative (tumor is <0.1 cm away, on  slide A7, A9, A10).    - Anterior lateral margin: Negative (tumor is >1 cm away, on slide  A6).    - Superior margin: Negative (tumor is >1 cm away).    - Inferior margin: Negative (tumor is >1 cm away).    Additional margin was submitted separately (Part B) and shows DCIS <0.1  cm from the new margin (black ink). Level sections were performed on  parts *****-***** to confirm the above diagnosis.    - Lobular carcinoma in situ: None.  - Non-neoplastic breast: Apocrine metaplasia, usual ductal hyperplasia,  fat necrosis.  - Lymph node status: N/A.  - AJCC/UICC stage: pTisNx.    - Tumor biomarker (ER/PR) status was positive.    At this time Ms. ***** is at her baseline. Her left breast is still somewhat sore subsequent to her surgery but she is in no severe pain. His weight is continuing to menstruate although she is having significant hot flashes and night sweats which have been going on about 9 months and perhaps are worsening. She has continues to have chronic low back pain but this is unchanged for her. Her appetite is good her activities are full her weight is stable and her bowel and bladder function are within normal limits               Patient Active Problem List   Diagnosis    Migraine    Chronic low back pain    Right-sided low back pain without sciatica    Current smoker    High blood pressure    Abnormal mammogram of left breast    DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ)            Past Medical History:   Diagnosis Date    Anemia     High blood pressure 11/27/2016             Past Surgical History:   Procedure Laterality Date    OVARIAN CYST REMOVAL Bilateral     Age 27             Allergies   Allergen Reactions    Penicillins Hives    Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen Hives        Current Medications           Current Outpatient Prescriptions   Medication Sig Dispense Refill    amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet Take 1

Chest wall examination is significant for a left breast which is bandaged in the dependent portion and very tender to palpation. To gentle palpation there is no suspicious mass other than the expected postsurgical firmness. The left axilla is clear as is the left supraclavicular and left infraclavicular area. The right breast is without suspicious mass as is the right axilla right supraclavicular and right infraclavicular area   Abdominal: Soft.

 Judgment and thought content normal.           Assessment:       I had a detailed discussion with Mrs. ***** about the nature of ductal carcinoma in situ and our general approach to treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ including the use of surgery and/or radiation to remove the growth from the breast so that it does not recur locally and the use of adjuvant systemic anti-hormonal therapy which also would help to decrease the risk of local recurrence. In addition I spoke about its primary preventative effect as well with the decrease in new breast cancer events of 50%. Since Ms. ***** is continuing to menstruate, although because she is having symptomatology of hot flashes and night sweats she may be in the perimenopausal period, I suggested that the drug of choice would be a tamoxifen if she were to contemplate anti-hormonal therapy. We went the mechanism of tamoxifen with both its pro-as well as antiestrogenic effects and its various side effects including exacerbation of postmenopausal symptomatology increases in hot flashes and night sweats, increase in clotting risk with increased risk of deep venous thrombosis as well as pulmonary embolus and stroke, and the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. Ms. ***** seemed to understand all of these issues fairly well. She is currently pending an appointment with ***** ***** to assess whether or not she will be a candidate for radiation therapy at this time. I will send a prescription for tamoxifen into her pharmacy but have told her to hold off on taking this drug until after she has her radiation oncology assessment.      Plan:       return to clinic 4-6 weeks after beginning tamoxifen to assess therapy tolerance
