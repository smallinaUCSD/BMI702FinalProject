CLINICAL HISTORY:   32 years old Female with right breast carcinoma, evaluate for metastatic disease.  TECHNIQUE:   Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours.  Following intravenous administration of 8.1 mCi of F18-FDG, a contrast enhanced, diagnostic CT was performed. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 52 minutes after FDG injection.  PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data.  PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted.  Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images.  Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 94 mg/dL.  RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: ***** ***** received 2 exposure event(s) (excluding scout) 
 during this CT study. The range of CTDIvol was 9.04 to 9.04 (mGy) and the TOTAL DLP was 923.24 (mGy-cm). The dose indicators for CT are the volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and the Dose Length Product (DLP), and are measured in units of mGy and mGy-cm, respectively. These indicators are not patient dose, but values generated from the CT scanner acquisition factors.  Individual patient doses calculated from these values will depend on patient size and can substantially underestimate or overestimate the actual dose.

FINDINGS: Brain:   Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.  No mass effect.  While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated. Neck:   No hypermetabolic neck masses or lymphadenopathy. Chest:   Lungs are clear. Prominent right axillary lymph node measures up to 9 mm a maximum SUV of 2.1 (series 4, image 66). Hypermetabolic right breast mass is better characterized on recent MRI breast and measures approximately 3.2 cm the maximum SUV of 8.4. Abdomen/Pelvis:   Unremarkable abdomino-pelvic organs.  No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal:   No metastatic disease.     1. Hypermetabolic breast mass better characterized on recent breast MRI. 2. Prominent right axillary lymph node with low-level hypermetabolism, corresponding to previously sampled lymph node. No additional hypermetabolic lymph nodes.

Core biopsy for clinical and research purposes. TECHNIQUE: Procedure was explained in detail to patient.  Risks (including risks of pain, infection, bleeding, non-recovery of targeted lesion, possible need for further intervention for diagnostic purposes), benefits, and alternatives discussed.  All questions were answered.  Written and verbal informed consent obtained.  This procedure immediately followed fine-needle aspiration.  Under sterile conditions, the lesion was re-identified at the 12 o'clock position, 3 cm from the nipple in the right breast. Following administration of a 1% Lidocaine with epinephrine, a small dermatotomy was made in the skin with a scalpel and a 14-16 gauge needle was placed under direct sonographic guidance with its tip at the lesion. Pre and post fire images demonstrated transgression of the needle through the lesion. A total of 8 biopsy samples were obtained (4 clinical, 4 research). Sterile Steri-Strips were placed at the incision site. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the department in satisfactory condition with instructions that if excessive bleeding or oozing should occur, she should contact her health care provider or visit an emergency room. She may obtain the results from her referring physician within 4 working days and if this is not possible, she may contact this department. 
     1.   Ultrasound guided core right breast biopsy for clinical and research purposes. 2.   Pathology pending. 3.   Fine needle aspiration of a right axillary lymph node was performed on the same date. Please see separate report. END OF IMPRESSION:     Mr Breast With And Without Contrast, Bilateral    Result Date: 04/15/2017  Exam Date: 04/15/2017 Exam(s): MR breast bilateral en + un Clinical History: 32-year-old woman with biopsy proven right breast cancer (outside hospital). Patient underwent repeat core biopsy here at ***** (with research cores) and fine needle aspiration of a suspicious right axillary node (results pending at the time of this MRI). Comparison: Prior examinations dated 04/11/2017 (ultrasound) and 03/19/2017 were reviewed for comparison. MRI Technique: Bilateral 1.5T breast MRI without and with contrast was performed with a dedicated breast coil using T1 and T2-weighted sequences including:  axial T2-weighted with fat saturation, high resolution T1 fat-suppressed 3D gradient echo pre-, and dynamic post-contrast sequences. Gadolinium based contrast was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.1 millimole per kilogram body weight without adverse reaction. The study was processed with a Hologic Aegis Sentinelle system to optimize interpretation by generating multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in 3 dimensions using raw and generated subtracted images from the dynamic contrast enhanced data set. MRI Findings: This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates moderate background enhancement. The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat. RIGHT Breast: There is a 34 x 20 x 25 mm irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the upper central to slightly outer right breast (axial image 59, sag image 413). Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. Susceptibility 
 artifact within the mass corresponds to the clip within the mass. No other abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified in the right breast. LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified. There is an enlarged right axillary lymph node with a cortex measuring up to 6 mm, likely corresponding to the recently sample axillary lymph node. IMPRESSION: Right breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6). Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1). Recommendations: Recommend continued surgical and oncologic follow up of the known right breast cancer. Additionally, recommend correlation with cytology results of the recently sampled suspicious right axillary node. Recommend continued annual screening mammography for the left breast, according to American Cancer Society guidelines.

END OF IMPRESSION:       Assessment and Plan:  Patient Active Problem List   Diagnosis    Breast cancer, right breast   IMP  ***** ***** is a 32 y.o. female without family history with new diagnosis of a grade 2 ER+ breast cancer, T2N1, clinical stage II  HER2 reviewed and is clinically not amplified so will treat as HER2 negative.  Mammoprint expected on Thursday of this week.  I had previously discussed ISPY2 with her in detail when she met our surgery team on 04/11/17 and signed consent at that time.  I reviewed the protocol and treatment again today including randomization, secondary consent, biopsies, MRI scans that are at least somewhat dependent on response, and novel agents currently in the study as well as the control arm.  We discussed the need for hormone therapy after surgery, the use of ovarian suppression and the side effects of OS.  We also talked about subsequent pregnancies, and when we recommend this depending on her response and stage at time of surgery.    We talked about standard of care therapy, including weekly paclitaxel x 12 followed by AC every 2-3 weeks with neulasta support, and including the short and long term toxicities with these therapies.  I have recommended a port for her treatment which she agrees to.  We reviewed her pathology and all of her imaging as well as her clear PET scan.    All of her questions were answered in full.  Plan:  04/23/17 echocardiogram and EKG  Hoping to do Mammi/PET on 05/01/17 - since we hope to start 
 chemotherapy then, we have worked with the imaging group and they were able to move her scan to April 29..  Port to be placed either on start of therapy or one week later.  Cold cap coordinator to call her.  Discussed the cold caps, and cost, as well as the success rate being relatively lower with AC.    Auth for chemotherapy placed as well as port.    Labs on Thursday.    Hopefully start neoadjuvant chemotherapy next week - planning for 05/01/17 assuming egg harvesting either Saturday or Monday.    Discussed toxicity in detail including hair loss, ovarian suppression, neuropathy, cardiac toxicity, small risk of secondary malignancies, and acute toxicities such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, nail changes, etc.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects and nutrition reviewed in detail.
