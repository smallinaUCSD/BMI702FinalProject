FINDINGS:  Lymph nodes: No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy.  Lungs: No metastases.  Abdominal and pelvic organs: No metastases.  Bones: No metastases.  Other: Right lateral breast dumbbell shaped enhancing hypermetabolic mass measures 2.7 x 1.7 cm (SUV Max 10.5 for largest component).    Non-oncologic findings:  Brain:   Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.  No mass effect.  While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.  Neck:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Chest:   Unchanged right upper lobe pleural-based mass measuring 2.4 cm x 1.0 cm, dating back to 08/18/2014, without significant FDG avidity. Unchanged left upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm in the left lower lobe (series 3, image 121 and image 32).  Abdomen/Pelvis:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Musculoskeletal:   Scattered bone islands in the pelvis are unchanged compared to 08/18/2014. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spine. Unchanged 3.4 cm lipomatous lesion in the right tensor fascia lata. Midline abdominal staples.    IMPRESSION: 
   Hypermetabolic  (FDG avid) right lateral breast mass measures 2.7 x 1.7 cm compatible with recurrent disease. No evidence of hypermetabolic metastatic disease.     Right breast diagnostic mammography, Limited R breast US 12/22/2017  Comparison:  Prior examinations dated 10/11/2017, 10/11/2017, 10/04/2017 (MRI) and 01/23/2017 were reviewed for comparison.    Mammographic Findings:  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.  BB marker on the upper outer right breast indicating patient-palpated lump corresponds to two masses, both biopsy-proven IDC (ribbon clip and heart clip). The irregular mass containing the ribbon clip now measures approximately 14 mm, previously 11 mm, and the more posterior obscured mass containing the heart clip now measures approximately 15 mm, previously 9 mm.  BB marker on the lower central/slightly outer right breast indicates second patient-palpated lump, for which there is no mammographic correlate.  Ultrasound Findings:  There is no sonographic abnormality (no correlate) to patient-palpated lump in the lower central/slightly outer right breast, at approximately 7 o'clock, 4 cm from nipple.  Limited ultrasound of the right axilla demonstrates lymph nodes with normal cortical thickness and morphology.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).    Recommendations:  1. Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management of two-site biopsy-proven right breast malignancy. Of note, right axillary lymph nodes appear sonographically normal at today's examination.    2. Recommend clinical follow up for patient-palpated lump in the lower central/slightly outer right breast, for which there is no mammographic nor sonographic correlate. If indicated, palpation-guided FNA could be pursued.    Bilateral MRI of Breasts 10/04/2017  Comparison:  Prior examinations dated 01/23/2017 (mammogram), 07/08/2016 and 11/10/2015 were reviewed for comparison.  MRI 
 Findings:  This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates minimum background enhancement.  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue.    RIGHT Breast:  There is a new 12 x 7 x 7 mm (ML x AP x CC) irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics.  This lesion is best seen on axial postcontrast image # 90 and sagittal reformation #341.  More posteriorly and laterally in the right breast, there is a second new 6 x 6 x 7 mm (ML x AP x CC) irregularly shaped mass with irregular margins. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics.  This lesion is best seen on image # 90 and sagittal reformation #363.    LEFT Breast:  The previously described area of non-mass enhancement with linear distribution and clumped internal enhancement in the lower outer left breast is significantly less conspicuous than on MRI dated 07/08/2016, and can no longer be accurately measured. No new abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Suspicious (BI-RADS 4).  Left breast: Benign (BI-RADS 2).    Recommendations:  1. Two new irregular masses demonstrating rapid enhancement with washout are noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Recommend diagnostic right breast mammogram with targeted ultrasound for further evaluation and biopsy planning, with possible stereotactic or ultrasound-guided biopsy to follow. If no correlate is identified by mammogram or ultrasound, then recommend MR-guided core biopsy.    2. Significant interval decrease in conspicuity of the previously described area of non-mass enhancement in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast, compatible with a benign etiology. Annual mammography in addition to MRI is recommended in patients undergoing 
 high-risk screening.        ASSESSMENT & PLAN  ***** ***** ***** is a 71 y.o. female with R breast cancer here for discussion for a new patient visit.       Breast Cancer  - Latest PETCT demonstrates growth of R breast lesion from 1.2 x 0.7 to 2.7 x 1.7 cm  - Patient unsure about starting chemo as we recommended today she would like to speak to Dr. ***** first.     Plan:  Port placement ASAP  Chemo teach ASAP for taxol x 12 weekly  Can start chemo as early as next Wednesday, but the following week also ok. She will need clinic visits with cycles 1, 2, 5, 8, and 12.        I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 45 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.
