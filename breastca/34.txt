ID: ***** ***** is a 33 y.o. premenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of a HR+ metastatic breast cancer involving lymph nodes, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    HPI: The patient was evaluated by her PCP on 10/30/16 at which time she reported a new right lateral neck lump.  Her exam was notable for a hard, mobile mass (1 cm) on her right lateral neck.  She was recommended to return in 2 weeks if not resolved.  She returned on 11/09/16 with concern that the lymph nodes were increasing in size (0.5 cm mobile mass in right anterior chain; 2 x 1 cm mass and subcentimeter masses of right lateral neck).  She was recommended to get a CBC and return in 2 weeks at which time, if persistent, they would obtain imaging.  She returned on 12/27/16 at which time she reported the LN were smaller and sore with palpation.  Her exam at that time was noted to be supple with a 0.5 cm soft, mobile LN in the right mid-cervical chain.  She was reassured the nodes were shotty and to continue to monitor them.  Finally, she returned on 03/26/17 with concern the nodes were grainy and stable in size, but had started to cause pain.  Her exam at that time demonstrated fullness (1.5 to 2 cm) along the right anterior and superior cervical chain as well as a firm round mass (2 x 2 cm) in the right lateral neck.  The following work-up was then initiated.    03/30/17 Neck US: diffuse bilateral submandibular, anterior, and posterior cervical adenopathy (R submandibular 3.6 x 1.7 cm; R anterior cervical chain 1.0 x 0.8 cm; L anterior cervical 2.7 x 1.0 cm; L posterior lateral neck inferiorly 0.9 x 0.7 cm); thyroid unremarkable    04/03/17 US-guided right supraclavicular LN biopsy: metastatic adenocarcinoma, c/w breast primary (CK7, GATA3, ER - positive; CK20, TTF1, thyroglobulin, napsin, mammaglobin - negative); ER+ (>90%), PR+ (50%), HER2 equivocal (IHC 2; FISH pending)    04/10/17 bilateral diagnostic 
 mammogram: extremely dense breast tissue; no features of primary malignancy in either breast; right axillary lymphadenopathy including an enlarged calcified LN  right breast ultrasound: multiple axillary LN with the cortex (0.8 cm); additionally, enlarged right axillary LN with calcifications    04/11/17 PET/CT: multiple FDG-avid right cervical LN (2.2 x 1.8 cm, SUV 6.0) in jugular chain; left Vb LN (0.8 cm, SUV 2.4); scattered subcentimeter thyroid nodules (non-FDG avid); multiple FDG-avid right axillary LN (2.7 x 1.7 cm, SUV 4.5); right supraclavicular LN (0.9 cm, SUV 3.5); heterogeneous breast tissue bilaterally with heterogeneous FDG-avidity, with slightly nodular area of uptake in upper outer right breast    04/12/17 MRI breast: marked background enhancement with the most confluent area of enhancement (3.5 cm) in right upper outer breast, posterior depth (which is slightly more prominent on right than left); superficial and smaller right axillary tail mass (1.5 x 0.5 x 1.0 cm) that may correspond to area of calcifications seen on mammogram; markedly enlarged right axillary LN with cortical thickness (up to 1 cm)    ***** presents to clinic today by herself.  She states she is aware that she now has a cancer diagnosis.  She asks many questions about how long she will live, repeatedly asking what the average prognosis for a patient with metastatic breast cancer.  The patient underwent menarche at 10 years of age.  She took OCP for 4 years.  She is G1P1.  Her first pregnancy was at 31 years of age.

 *****  Med. Rec.#: *****  DOB: 08/20/1983 (Age: 33)  Sex: Female  Accession #: *****-*****  Visit #: *****  Service Date: 04/03/2017  Received: 04/03/2017  Location: *****  Client: *****   Physician(s): ***** *****. ***** ((*****) *****-*****)    Source of Specimen:  Right supraclavicular lymph node, US guided fine needle aspiration    FINAL CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:  Right supraclavicular lymph node, US guided fine needle aspiration:   Metastatic adenoccarcinoma, consistent with breast primary; see comment.       COMMENTS:   The aspirates are moderately cellular and demonstrate clusters of  crowded, malignant epithelial cells arranged in cohesive aggregates and  papillary-like groups. The cells contain enlarged and angulated  hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse chromatin, nuclear grooves, and one to  multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm is dense and eosinophilic, imparting  and apocrine appearnce. A rare intranuclear pseudoinclusion and  scattered mitotic figures are identified.    To further evaluate the neoplastic cells immunohistochemical stains were  performed and evaluated on the cell block and show the following  results:  - CK7: Positive  - CK20: Negative  - Thyroglobulin: Negative  - TTF1: Negative  - Napsin: Negative  - p40: Negative  - p63: Negative  - Mammaglobin: Negative  - GATA3: Positive  - GCDFP15: Negative  - PAX8: Negative  - ER: Positive     The cytopathologic and immunohistochemical findings are most compatible  with metastatic carcinoma of breast primary. Correlation with clinical  and radiologic findings is recommended.    ***** *****, NP, at ***** ***** was contacted with the diagnosis on  04/06/2017. She relayed an understanding of the diagnosis.    Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2  and Ki-67 were performed by manual morphometry on the cell block.    The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear  staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive 
 control is present,  and external positive control is appropriate.    The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is variable  (weak to strong, November 28+) nuclear staining in 50% of tumor cells. Internal  positive control is present, and external positive control is  appropriate.    Result of HER2 test: This carcinoma is equivocal for HER2 oncoprotein  over-expression. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a  scale of 0-3.     ***** *****/Pathology Resident   ***** ***** *****/Pathologist  Electronically signed out on *****/*****/***** *****:*****:19    Addendum   Date Ordered:   04/06/2017   Status:  Signed Out    Date Complete:   04/10/2017   By: ***** *****    Date Reported:   04/10/2017     Addendum Diagnosis    - CA125: Weak patchy staining  - CAIX: Negative   - RCC: Negative  - Calcitonin: Negative    The additional immunohistochemical stains support the morphologic  findings. The previously reported diagnosis remains unchanged.     Exam Date: 04/10/2017  Exam(s): Bilateral diagnostic mammography, right breast ultrasound    Clinical History:  33-year-old woman having diagnostic mammography to evaluate for primary breast malignancy. Patient had recent cervical lymph node FNA positive for breast adenocarcinoma. Receptors are pending per APEX.    Comparison:  There are no prior examinations available for comparison.    Mammographic Findings:  The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.  There is right axillary lymphadenopathy including an enlarged calcified lymph node.  No mammographic features of primary malignancy in the right or left breast.    Ultrasound Findings:  There are multiple axillary lymph nodes with the cortex measuring up to 8mm. Additionally there is an enlarged right axillary lymph node with calcifications, which corresponds to the right axillary calcified enlarged lymph node on mammogram.    IMPRESSION:  Right breast: 
 Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    Recommendations:  Breast MRI to evaluate for underlying breast primary malignancy which is scheduled for 04/12/17. Patient is also scheduled for PET/CT tomorrow to evaluate for additional sites of disease.    Findings and management plan discussed with patient during the exam by Dr. *****.    A letter explaining this interpretation in lay language has been sent to the patient.    Radiologist  ***** *****. *****, M.D., Ph.D.    <This report was electronically signed by ***** *****. *****, M.D., Ph.D. at *****/*****/***** *****:23:13 AM>    Exam Date: 04/12/2017  Exam(s): MR breast bilateral en + un    Clinical History:  33-year-old woman status post palpation-guided FNA of cervical lymph node demonstrating metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with breast carcinoma, no definite primary breast lesion identified on mammogram and ultrasound, with PET/CT demonstrating possible increased FDG avidity in the outer right breast, here for evaluation for a primary breast lesion.    Comparison:  Prior examinations dated 04/10/2017 (ultrasound) and 04/10/2017 (mammogram) were reviewed for comparison.    MRI Findings:  This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates marked background enhancement.  The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat.    RIGHT Breast:  Marked background enhancement is seen, with the most confluent area of enhancement occurring in the right upper outer breast, posterior depth (best seen on post-gadolinium axial image #101, sagittal image #363), measuring up to 3.5 cm in AP dimension. This is only slightly more prominent on the right compared with the left side, and appears to correspond with the area noted on recent PET CT.  A more superficial and smaller right axillary tail mass is seen measuring approximately 1.5 x 0.5 x 1.0 cm (best seen on post-gadolinium axial image #104, sagittal image #369), which 
 demonstrates suggestion of susceptibility artifact on T1 imaging and may correspond to the area of calcifications seen on mammogram. This appears to enhance with slightly greater intensity than the breast tissue described above.    LEFT Breast:  Marked background enhancement is seen. No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    OTHER:  Markedly enlarged right axillary lymph nodes are seen with cortical thickness measuring up to 1 cm. Left axillary lymph nodes are unremarkable. Visualized abdomen and remainder of the chest is unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:  Right breast: Suspicious (BI-RADS 4).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    Recommendations:  1. Recommend second look ultrasound to evaluate 2 areas: (1) the area of more confluent enhancement in the upper outer right breast and (2) the right axillary tail mass which may correspond to the calcification-containing lesion on mammogram, with plan for ultrasound-guided core biopsy of these areas if correlates can be found, else recommend MRI-guided biopsy.    2. Abnormally enlarged right axillary lymph nodes are again seen, compatible with known metastatic disease.    Radiologist  ***** *****, MD    <This report was electronically signed by ***** *****, MD at *****/*****/***** *****:*****:17 PM>    PET/CT Whole Body (vertex to thighs) *****/*****/***** 9:49 AM    COMPARISON: None    REASON FOR THE STUDY: Staging.    CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 years old Female with newly diagnosed right supraclavicular node positive for breast cancer.      FINDINGS:    Brain: Study limited by patient motion. Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. No mass effect. While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.    Neck: Multiple hypermetabolic right cervical lymph nodes measuring up to 
 2.2 x 1.8 cm in the jugular chain with SUV max of 6.0 (series 3 image 50). Additional 0.8 cm left Vb lymph node with SUV max of 2.4. Scattered non-FDG avid subcentimeter thyroid nodules.     Chest: Multiple hypermetabolic right axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 2.7 x 1.7 cm with SUV max of 4.5 (series 3 image 67). Previously biopsied 0.9 cm hypermetabolic right supraclavicular lymph node with SUV max of 3.5. Heterogeneous breast tissue noted bilaterally with heterogeneous FDG avidity, with an area of increased FDG avidity which appears slightly nodular in the upper outer right breast. Lungs are clear.     Abdomen/Pelvis: Unremarkable abdomino-pelvic organs. Normal appendix. No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy.    Musculoskeletal: No metastatic disease.    IMPRESSION:     1. Hypermetabolic ,enlarged ,right supraclavicular, right axillary, and right cervical lymphadenopathy compatible with metastatic disease.    2. Mildly hypermetabolic left cervical lymph nodes may represent additional metastases.    3. No definite primary seen, however heterogeneous breast tissue with nodular area of increased FDG avidity noted in the outer right breast. Correlate with mammographic findings.    This study was reviewed by attendings Dr. ***** ***** from ***** ***** and Dr. ***** ***** ***** of Nuclear Medicine.    END OF IMPRESSION    Assessment and Recommendations:  33 y.o. premenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of HR+ breast cancer metastasized to a supraclavicular lymph node, and presumptively to cervical nodes, who requires additional work-up prior to receiving complete treatment recommendations.    I discussed with ***** in great detail the natural history and treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.  We reviewed the available pathology and imaging reports.  As her workup is not yet complete, I could not provide a complete explanation.  Presumptively, she has a primary breast cancer that 
 has metastasized to axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes.  In order to prove this hypothesis, she will need a core biopsy of suspicious breast tissue (if possible) as well as an FNA of a cervical lymph node.  She has no other evidence of distant metastasis.  I stated that it is unlikely, but she could have a second primary involving her cervical nodes.    I explained to ***** that if we confirm the above with breast and cervical LN biopsies, then she would be given a diagnosis of a de novo MBC.  I explained that technically, we do not consider MBC to be curable.  I stated that this disease is treatable, however, and that many patients live for many years.  She asked many questions about prognosis (repeatedly), and I did my best to help her understand that it is difficult to predict prognosis in the setting of a disease like hers and that we will learn about her disease's biology (and long term prognosis) after she starts a therapy.    Her HER2 status is not yet complete; she was noted to have HER2 equivocal by IHC and the FISH is not yet resulted.  I stated that if she does have HER2 positive disease, she would have even more treatment options, which would include chemotherapy initially.  I explained that if she has HER2 negative disease, then we would initiate treatment with antiestrogen therapy (not chemotherapy).    The patient will return to clinic once additional testing has been completed.    Recommendations in Brief:  - US-guided biopsy of breast mass (possibly calcified nodule in axillary tail)  - cervical LN FNA if possible  - f/u on HER2 FISH result  - genetic testing    I spent a total of 100 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 95 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.
