***** ***** is a 53 y.o. female with newly diagnosed HR-negative HER2+ breast cancer here to discuss systemic therapy and management    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    06/09/16 right diagnostic mammo with 3D Tomo- spiculated mass measuring 2.2 cm at   10-11:00    in right breast with adjacent architectural distortion and nodularity.   Ultrasound showed 1.6 cm mass at 10:00 3CFN, another 1 cm mass and 0.5 adjacent mass. Suspicious right axillary node    06/30/16 right breast core biopsy - IDC  G2, no LVI, ER-neg, PR neg, HER2 3+, FISH ratio 13,  Ki67 10-15%, FISH   Right axillary LN FNA: +metastatic breast adenoca    07/22/16 Breast MRI -   RIGHT - multiple right breast masses. 2.4 x 1.7 cm with clip, similar adjacent mass 2.4x1.6 cm also with clip. Multiple additional smaller masses. Enlarged level 1 and level 2 axillary LNs, the largest level 1 node is 3.5 x 1.7 cm  LEFT : negative      07/24/16 PET CT : . Solitary small focus of hypermetabolism in left ilium without definite CT correlate is concerning for metastatic disease.  Right breast mass compatible the patient's known primary breast cancer and multiple right axillary and subpectoral lymph nodes consistent with lymph node metastases.  3.4 x 2.6 cm hyperattenuating and mildly hypermetabolic lesion seen around the left carotid artery bifurcation may represent a carotid body tumor.     07/31/16 MRI Pelvis:  At least 3 rounded foci of signal abnormality and enhancement involving the left iliac bone and bilateral sacral ala, measuring up to 12 mm, suspicious for osseous metastatic disease.       *****/*****/*****: MR Face/Neck :  Avidly enhancing left carotid bifurcation mass with flow voids and splaying of the proximal internal and external carotid arteries. The imaging characteristics are suggestive of a carotid body paraganglioma.        The patient is accompanied by her husband today. She has no bone pain or any other systemic concerns. She says her neck mass is longstanding and

Her PET CT is suspicious for bone metastasis. To complete her staging work up we will need MRI of pelvis and biopsy for definitive stage IV diagnosis.  If stage IV will initiate systemic therapy with weekly paclitaxel, q3wk trastuzumab, q3wk pertuzumab. Given HR-negative HER2+ subtype, I anticipate excellent response and possible long term disease control. She is asymptomatic from bone lesion but we can radiate bone lesions as well.     Plan:  MRI Pelvis  MRI neck - like cartoid body, longstanding  Chemoteach for weekly paclitaxel, q3wk trastuzumab, q3wk pertuzumab  Baseline echocardiogram  Port placement  labs      1. The patient concerns were discussed in detail. Patient verbalizes understanding of these issues and agrees with the plan.   2. Reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.   3. I reviewed the patient's medical information and medical history.   4. I have reviewed the past medical, family, and social history sections including the medications and allergies listed in the above medical 
 record.   5. Total face to face time: 60 ***** counseling time: 50
