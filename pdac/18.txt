  This is an independent visit    SUBJECTIVE  This is a very pleasant 69-year-old African-American woman from *****, *****. She has recently relocated to *****. She has a diagnosis of locally advanced and unresectable adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.    She presented with abdominal pain and weight loss as early as November and December 2016. Eventually, she went to the emergency room in February 2017 and received pain medications and a workup was initiated. CT scan of the abdomen done on 03/08/2017 showed a mass measuring 3.6 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm. Vascular involvement was not described. An 11 mm lesion in the liver was seen but not characterized or biopsied. EUS done on February 21 showed a mass in the uncinate process and involvement of the SMA. FNA of the mass revealed an adenocarcinoma.    She was initially started on treatment with gemcitabine and Abraxane but had demonstrated radiographic progression on 06/14/2017. At that point, she was started on dose modified FOLFIRINOX (C1D1 on 07/31/17).     08/15/2017: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX     Interim History:  Patient reports increase fatigue over the past 3 weeks. She is sitting most of the day but can perform all of her ADLs. She most recently moved in with her daughter and is living with her in ***** and is able to get up and go for short walks.     Has also experienced increased emesis, nausea, and burping. Has 2 or 3 episodes of emesis a day, which are not associated with eating. Has only tried Zofran twice, states that medication did help, but she is trying to avoid taking too many meds and so has been hesitant to take zofran more often.    Continues to take Creon 3 tabs with meals/2 tabs with snacks. Her upper abdominal pain continues but is helped by taking Methadone BID and Oxycodone PRN (usually twice a day as needed).     Reports 1 wk history of bilateral LE edema. Elevating her legs up does help to decrease swelling. Denies leg pain, SOB, chest 
 pain.     Also endorses continued poor appetite, but has gained some weight.     Reports recent onset of dark colored urine x 3 days. Denies fevers, chills, pruritis.

ASSESSMENT / PLAN:  1. Localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, on therapy with uncertain disease control  Patient is now s/p 2 cycles of FOLFIRINOX. She presents for C3 today but labs are worrisome for disease progression, biliary obstruction, or ascending cholangitis: T bili 7.4, Alk Phos 493, AST 357, ALT 387    Given that her most recent CT was performed almost 3 months ago (outside CT from 06/14/17) plus today's evidence of hyperbilirubinemia, I have recommended that we postpone today's infusion and have her undergo urgent imaging to rule out biliary ductal dilatation versus disease progression in the liver. ED precautions were reviewed with patient and her daughter. As she may be at risk for cholangitis, she was advised to present to local ED ASAP if she develops fevers/chills. Furthermore, as she presents with daily emesis, which could indicate partial small bowel obstruction, she was also advised to go to ED if she is unable to tolerate any PO intake.     2. Bilateral LE edema  Will have pt undergo bilateral US today to r/o DVT.     3. Multiple symptoms  Encouraged referral to SMS to help with management of her pain, fatigue, and anorexia. Pt agrees to this consultation.     I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis and symptoms    ***** *****, NP    ADDENDUM:   Today's CT scan indicates the 
 following:  1.  In comparison to 06/14/2017, interval increase in size of ill-defined pancreatic head/uncinate process mass, resulting in obstruction of the biliary system distally with proximal intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Increased pancreatic ductal dilatation.    2.  Increased distention of the stomach with narrowing of the third portion of duodenum, likely due to mass effect from adjacent pancreatic mass, concerning for developing or partial obstruction.    An urgent referral to GI for an ERCP was placed.     Pt was also called and informed of these findings. ED precautions were reviewed.     Lower extremity US did not identify any DVTs.    ***** *****, NP
