Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** is a 86 y.o.  female who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     -November 2018: Presented to her primary care doctor with painless jaundice and 15lb weight loss since *****.    -*****/*****/*****: labs notable for a Tbili of 15.8, AST 110, ALT 133, Alk phos 199.   -12/02/18: CT abdomen/pelvis: intra/extrahepatic biliary dilatation (CBD 22mm) with transition point in the pancreatic head.  9x7mm mass in the pancreatic head, 8mm periportal lymph node  -12/12/18: syncopized while in waiting room for planned ERCP.  Admitted for:       -CTA chest: negative for PE       -ERCP 12/13/18: (Tbili at that time 14.7) high grade obstruction in the distal bile duct.  Placement of a pigtail stent.  Brushings; pancreatic adenocarcinoma (no MMR testing)      -discharged December 16 with Tbili 12.9,  s/p IVF for orthostatic hypotension  -12/22/18: presented to ED again with syncopal episode due to orthostatic hypotension, again received IVF and was discharged home.  Labs notable for: T bili 8.0  -01/13/19: PET/CT: 1. Focal area of hypermetabolism in the pancreatic head/neck and upstream pancreatic ductal dilation with parenchymal atrophy suggestive of primary pancreatic malignancy. Primary mass is not definitely visualized, though a possible hypodense lesion corresponding to this area of hypermetabolism measures 1.1 cm.  2. Hypermetabolic peripancreatic and periportal lymph nodes concerning for metastatic 
 disease. 3. Interval placement of common bile duct stent with interval improvement in moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, previously severe. Mild hypermetabolism surrounding the common bile duct may be postprocedural. Attention on follow-up. 4. Left mid kidney 1.3 cm intermediate density lesion is indeterminate and may represent a hemorrhagic cyst versus solid renal mass. Attention on follow-up.    01/31/19: Initial consultation in our clinic    03/08/19: ERCP reveals high grade obstruction of the intrapancreatic portion of the CBD with proximal dilation. A metal stent was placed across the stricture and was fully expanded across the stricture with proximal pneumobilia.    03/09/19: C1D1 Gemcitabine   03/13/19: CT CAP reveals stable disease in the liver and no evidence of metastatic disease  03/28/19: C1D8  04/04/19:  C1D15  04/18/19: C2D1 04/25/19: C2D8 held due to concern about potential dental abscess  04/26/19: Patient evaluated by her dentist; found to have periodontal inflammation and a deep pocket associated with her last left lower molar, which has been a chronic problem for her. Tooth was irrigated and rinsed with chlorhexidine. Patient to continue to use chlorhexidine rinse BID. No infection noted and ok'ed to continue on chemotherapy.    05/08/19: CT CAP reports ill-defined pancreatic mass is no longer seen. Dr. ***** recommends switching regimen to be on alternating weeks for better tolerability.     Interim History  No more gum bleeding. Her energy level is low and her appetite is low. She has not been eating as well and losing weight. She also has not been walking outside as much as before. She is trying to eat small frequent meals.

RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: Exposure Events: 7 , CTDIvol Min: 3.5 mGy, CTDIvol Max: 9.3 mGy, DLP: 628.9 mGy.cm. The following accession numbers are related to this dose report *****,*****,***** *****: LUNGS: No new lung nodules. A few scattered sub-3 mm solid nodules are unchanged compared to multiple remote priors. 16mm mixed solid and groundglass nodule in the left upper lobe (image 84, series 20) with a 3 mm soft tissue component, and adjacent 7 mm groundglass nodule in the left upper lobe (image 81) are unchanged. PLEURA: The pleura is normal. MEDIASTINUM: No intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Unchanged heart size. No pericardial effusion. Thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery are unchanged caliber. BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No new bone or soft tissue lesions in the chest. VISIBLE ABDOMEN: Please see dedicated Abdomen and Pelvis CT report.     1. No new findings to suggest intrathoracic metastatic disease. 2. 2 subsolid left 
 upper lobe nodules likely represent primary lung adenocarcinoma lesions as previously described. The largest nodule is 16 mm with a 3 mm solid component. Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging    Cancer Staging  Pancreatic cancer (HCC)  Staging form: Exocrine Pancreas, AJCC 8th Edition  - Clinical stage from 02/02/2019: Stage IIB (cT1c, cN1, cM0) - Signed by ***** *****, MD on 02/02/2019    ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** is a 86 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     Given her age, comorbidities and preference, she is not a candidate for surgical resection.  As such, the mainstay of treatment for her would be systemic therapy, given with a goal of palliating any symptoms she may have, and achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but this treatment was not expected to be curative.     Patient started dose reduced gemcitabine monotherapy on 03/09/19. She presents for consideration of C2D15 today. This was delayed from last week due to concern for potential dental abscess. Since then, she has been evaluated by her dentist and cleared for chemotherapy today.      Her scans obtained on 05/08/19 showed that the ill-defined pancreatic mass is no longer seen, likely related to treatment. Interval decrease in pancreatic duct dilation. No evidence of metastatic disease. Of note, there was a 1.1 cm left renal enhancing lesion concerning for renal cell carcinoma. 2 subsolid left upper lobe nodules likely represent primary lung adenocarcinoma lesions. The largest nodule is 16 mm with a 3 mm solid component. I reviewed the results of these scans with the patient and her family today. I informed them that due to the agressiveness 
 of the pancreatic cancer, our focus will continue to be treating that. We will monitor the renal lesion and pulmonary nodules closely.    We will continue with gemcitabine monotherapy but we will change to alternating week schedule for better tolerability.    - Plan to continue with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT cap with contrast every 2 months to monitor treatment response. Her next set of scans will be due after this cycle.     #Left gum pain and bleeding: cleared by her dentist as no sign of infection.   - We will defer to her dentist regarding continued monitoring; pt to continue to chlorhexidine rinses bid.    #Supportive care: Influenza vaccine ordered today (to be given at infusion center). We will refer to nutritionist. She is taking sennokot 4 times per week. I recommended that she take on a daily basis. She has supply of antiemetics and takes as needed. I recommended maintaining her weight and activity level.     #Follow-up: on 05/16/19 with ***** *****. As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.    I spent a total of 40minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the symptoms, treatment plan, risks and/or therapeutic options for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor in ***** *****   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
