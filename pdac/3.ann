Endoscope advanced to the duodenum with subsequent wire cannulization of the metallic common bile duct stent. Wire was passed beyond the stent into the intrahepatic bile ducts with subsequent cholangiogram demonstrating irregular moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with filling defects related to sludge or stones. Irregular narrowing of the common bile duct in the region of the stent with subsequent balloon sweeping related to known history of pancreatic cancer. Sweeping of the right intrahepatic bile duct was also performed. A likely second metal stent was deployed within the existing metallic common bile duct stent. Please refer to a separate report by the physician who performed the procedure for further details.
