Diagnosis made in March and surgery has been delayed due to COVID19.  Unclear when Dr. ***** and ***** will be able to do surgery at *****.  I have talked with Dr. ***** and as of today, the date is unknown.  She has been offered surgery at *****, but would prefer to stick with this team of surgeons.    We discussed the biology of her cancer, and the prevalence.  We reviewed the imaging and her pathology in detail.  I reviewed the data that supports the use of ovarian suppression in woman with HR+ breast cancer under the age of 35, as the general duration of endocrine therapy which at present would be 5 years.  She was curious about the benefits relatively of shorter duration endocrine therapy , and whether two years would be good enough - and we 
 reviewed that the current studies are based on the knowledge that 5 years is not good enough for many cancers like this due to late recurrence risks, so we would not advise shorter durations.    We then talked about different endocrine therapy approaches.  I would be concerned about using tamoxifen alone, both for efficacy which what appears to be at least a 2 cm cancer on exam and for the risks of depression that could be difficult given her underlying bipolar II disorder.    We discussed to toxicities of OS with monthly goserelin, as well as the toxicities of tamoxifen versus an AI.  She would prefer to start with an AI, and I have told her that we will wait two weeks to at least have OS start working.  I also advised her about the menses that often occur two weeks after starting OS    Plan  Start goserelin today (no auth required!)  Start letrozole in about two weeks  Message sent to *****. ***** to discuss surgery timing  Discussed lumpectomy versus mastectomy; she is certain about bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction  Hot soaks to stye  Labs today including estradiol    We talked about treatment of hot flashes and she will ask her psychiatrist about the interaction of effexor and gabapentin and her lamictal and underlying bipolar II disorder.    RTC one month depending on plans for surgery.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects and nutrition reviewed in detail.
