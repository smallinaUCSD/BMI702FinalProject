ID: ***** ***** ***** is a 67 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of early stage breast cancer, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    Date of Service: 03/08/17    HPI: The patient underwent a right breast partial mastectomy on 07/06/14 to remove a lipoma; she had no evidence of malignancy at that time. She also underwent an FNA in the right breast at the 9:00 position, 11 cm from the nipple on 11/09/14 which revealed benign breast tissue in association with scar and surgical site changes.  She had normal mammogram in June 2015 and July 2016.  She felt a mass in her right breast in late January and a subsequent evaluation led to a diagnosis of breast cancer.  Evaluation to date is as follows:    07/12/15 screening mammogram: heterogeneously dense breast tissue; no features of malignancy; right breast post-surgical scarring    07/16/16 screening mammogram: heterogeneously dense breast tissue; no mammographic features of malignancy     02/15/17 right diagnostic mammogram: irregular mass with spiculated margins in lower slightly outer right breast, posterior depth; heterogeneously dense breast tissue  Right breast ultrasound: irregular solid mass (2.4 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm) with spiculated margins in lower outer right breast at 7:00 position, 5 cm from nipple (at site of palpable lump); irregular solid mass (1.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm) with spiculated margins in lower outer right breast at 8:00 position, 5 cm from nipple (a 2nd smaller palpable lump); non-enlarged morphologically normal appearing LN in right axilla  right breast FNA at 7:00 position, 4 cm from nipple: adenocarcinoma    02/22/17  US-guided core biopsy of right breast mass at 7:00 position, 5 cm from nipple: 1.2 cm grade 2 invasive mammary carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features, ER+ >95%, PR+ ~70%, HER2- (IHC 0; FISH ratio 0.65), Ki-67 ~20%  US-guided right breast FNA at 8:00 position, 5 cm from   nipple: adenocarcinoma  US-guided right breast FNA at 7:00 position, 7 cm from nipple: adenocarcinoma    02/19/17 Breast MRI: irregularly shaped mass (2.2 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm) with spiculated margins in lower outer right breast (corresponding to 7:00 position mass on US and palpable-FNA guided biopsy proven carcinoma); in the lower outer right breast, slightly superior and lateral to biopsy proven carcinoma, an irregular enhancing mass (1.5 x 1.2 x 1.8 cm) (corresponding to 8:00 position mass on US); enhancing oval circumscribed mass (0.5 cm) located 1.5 cm directly posterior to 7:00 position mass with faint NME extending from posterior aspect of 7:00 position mass to this mass; no adenopathy or chest wall involvement; left breast unremarkable    02/20/17 PET/CT: no evidence of metastatic disease; 2 hypermetabolic enhancing nodules within right breast; sclerotic foci within left ileum, right pubic symphysis, and left ischium likely representing bone islands; mild uptake along distal esophagus (likely esophagitis)    The patient presents to clinic today with her husband.  She feels well and states that she is not surprised by her diagnosis as her paternal great aunts and her mother all suffered from breast cancer and that she has therefore always expected such a diagnosis.  She is active: swims a mile many times a week in the summer, walks a lot on a daily basis, and rides horses.    The patient's gynecologic history is as follows.  She underwent menarche at 12-13 years of age.  She started taking OCP at 16 years of age for very irregular periods at 16.  She is G3P2.  She used Clomid in 30s.  Her first pregnancy was at 30 years of age.  She believes she underwent menopause at 57.  Had nightsweats for years and hot flashes.  She has no history of HRT.

I discussed with the patient 
 and her husband in great detail the natural history and treatment of a MP high risk, clinically high risk, node-negative HR positive breast cancer.  We reviewed the pathology report and discussed the multimodality approach of breast cancer treatment.  I encouraged her that she currently has no evidence of metastatic disease and that we can therefore treat her with curative intent.  The patient understands that her treatment will include chemotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy, and possibly radiation.  We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to assess response to treatment, and to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery.  I discussed the chemotherapy regimens that would be recommended as the standard of care, and discussed how these regimens would be different in the context of the I-SPY2 clinical trial.   The patient was screened for ISPY2 but has already decided that she does not want to participate.      I discussed the regimens typically used for the treatment of HR+ breast cancer when chemotherapy is recommended.  We discussed treatment with AC/T (or T/AC) with 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks followed by 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel.  We also discussed the regimen of docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (TC), given every 3 weeks for 4 to 6 cycles.  I referred to data from the Anthracyclines in Breast Cancer clinical trial in which patients with node-negative HR+/HER2- breast cancer did not gain additional benefit from taxane/anthracyline regimens over 6 cycles of TC.  I then explained that we do not generally give TC as a neoadjuvant regimen there is no certainty of node-negativity until after surgery and if a patient were to have evidence of positive LN after receiving TC there would be concern that they had not received an anthracycline.    The patient, however, prefers to receive chemotherapy upfront (in light that chemo 
 is recommended) and therefore prefers to proceed with AC/T.  She is aiming for a lumpectomy and at this time would only be able to have a mastectomy.  I specifically discussed with the patient the typical and less common side-effects associated with AC/T, such as fatigue, neuropathy, skin and nail changes, myalgias, alopecia, myelosuppression, nausea).  I stated that patients who receive AC, are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity (acute and distant, 1-3%), which can result in asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure with dyspnea and chest pain.  I also explained that AC is associated with an increased risk (1-3%) of secondary leukemias.    After an extensive discussion, the patient states that she understands the rationale for neoadjuvant treatment and will proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, specifically AC/T. In order to start treatment, she will first require chemotherapy teaching as well as an echocardiogram.  She also stated interest in cold caps and we will have the CRC contact her to share specific details.   We will additionally have a port placed, which was explained to her and to which she has agreed.    Recommendations in Brief:  - echocardiogram  - chemo teach  - port placement  - discussion with cold cap CRC  - prior auth  - plan to start with AC, ideally first week of March (March 19 or March 20)    The patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks.    I spent a total of 100 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 95 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.
