HPI:  ***** ***** ***** is a 58 y.o. female here in consultation to discuss treatment options for her newly diagnosed breast cancer whose history is as follows:          Patient Active Problem List    Diagnosis Date Noted    Breast cancer, left breast 06/24/2017     Stage IIb (T2N1M0) Gr 2 IDC (ER pos/PR pos/Her-2-neu neg)  March 2017 patient found a left breast mass measuring 2cm after she felt a pinch in her left breast  Saw primary care doctor  04/10/17 BL Dx mammogram: L irregular mass 20 mm with spiculated margins at 12 o'clock  04/10/17 US L 12 o'clock 2 cm from the nipple with solid mass 17 mm   04/21/17: US Guided Needle Core biopsy Gr 2 IDC ER+ >95% PR+ 25%,HER-2/neg by IHC 1+, Ki-67 >30%  FISH not amplified  04/30/17 Left lumpectomy and SLNBx by Dr. ***** ***** *****: gr 2 IDC, 3.6cm, + LVI, margins positive, 2/2 lymph nodes involved (largest 1.8cm with extracapsular extension).   Postoperative MRI 05/06/17 enhancement surrounding the surgical site suspicious for residual disease and a 4mm focus of enhancement in the L breast at 6 o'clock.   MRI guided biopsy 05/20/17 of this additional area revealed proliferative fibrocystic change without atypia.   05/19/17 BRCA test negative by report (Ambry - not sure whether panel or only BRCA)  06/04/17 Surgical re-excision left breast, lumpectomy re-excision:1.)Residual IDC spans 2cm  2.)Invasive carcinoma at deep margin in one small focus  Comment:The description of tumor 'spanning 2cm' in this specimen is probably naturally going to be interpreted as a much larger lesional  volume than the aggregate of the small residual tumor deposits actually warrant.The largest of these foci is only 6mm x 4mm in cross section.  A much smaller residual deposit (2 x 1mm) is at the deep resection margin (Block *****).       Patient reports mild left breast pain status post lumpectomy re-excision on 06/04/2107. It is intermittent and described as "pinching" sensation which is 
 tolerable. ***** notes that she has very supportive family/friends that live nearby.   She is very upset about her diagnosis and need for treatment.      She is going to ***** in February for her niece's *****.

A time out was held. The patient's left breast was prepped in the usual sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved with 1% lidocaine, along with 1% lidocaine with diluted epinephrine Gadolinium based contrast (5 cc of Gadavist) was administered intravenously without difficulty and the finding in question at the posterior left 6:00 position was visualized. Using MRI guidance and grid compression, a 9 gauge vacuum assisted core biopsy device was used to obtain tissue samples. A titanium marker was placed after the biopsy. The patient tolerated procedure well with no immediate Complications. Pathology showed proliferative fibrocystic changes without atypia.   IMPRESSIONS:  MRI-guided core biopsy of a 4 mm focus of 
 contrastenhancement in the posterior, lower (6:00) region of the left breast.Pathology showed fibrocystic changes.This is concordant with the imaging findings.Recommendation would be for breast MRI in 6 months as per the usual imaging surveillance protocol for benign concordant diagnosis.  05/09/2017 Left Breast Ultrasound Limited  LEFT ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: A targeted ultrasound was performed of the left breast at 6 o'clock located 3 centimeters from the nipple. There is no sonographic correlate to the MRI finding in the left lower central breast  IMPRESSION  There is no sonographic finding to the MRI finding of a 4 mm focus of enhancement in the left lower central breast. Therefore, recommend MRI-guided biopsy of the focus of enhancement in the left lower central breast, as per MRI report. The results of this examination were reviewed directly with the patient by a member of the Breast Health Center, and a written summary report was provided to her. BI-RADS Category 1 : Negative    05/06/2017 MRI BREAST BILATERAL WWO CONTRAST  FINDINGS: The breasts demonstrate heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. There is minimal background enhancement that is symmetric.  Right breast: There are no abnormal areas of contrast enhancement.  Left breast: Postoperative changes in the left breast with a seroma in the left breast at 12:00 extending from the nipple areolar complex to the pectoralis muscle. The seroma measures 8.6 x 4.6 cm (AP, transverse). The craniocaudal extent of the anterior portion of the seroma measures 5.1 cm in the posterior portion measures 2.9 cm. The posterior portion of the seroma measures 3.4 x 1.1 x 2.9 cm (AP, transverse, CC). There is peripheral enhancement surrounding the seroma. There is irregular peripheral enhancement along the anterolateral superior margin of the anterior portion of the seroma (postcontrast axial image 54 and 49 and sagittal image 32) and along the posterolateral aspect of the 
 anterior portion of the seroma (postcontrast axial image 42 and sagittal 39). The nodular peripheral enhancement extends to the nipple areolar complex. There is also nodular peripheral enhancement along the medial margin of the anterior portion of the seroma(postcontrast axial image 45 and sagittal image 53). The peripheral enhancement demonstrates type I kinetics. No fat plane between the peripheral enhancement of the seroma and the left pectoralis muscle. 4 x 2 x 4 mm focus of enhancement in the posterior left breast at 6:00 (postcontrast axial image 72 and sagittal image 44). Kinetics curve assessment demonstrates type I enhancement There is diffuse skin thickening, likely related to postoperative changes.  Other: Postoperative seroma in the left axilla from recent sentinel lymph node dissection measuring 6.6 x 4.0 x at least 5.5 cm (AP, transverse, CC). The full craniocaudad extent of this seroma is not imaged. There is thin peripheral enhancement surrounding the seroma, which is due to postoperative changes. There is no axillary or internal mammary lymphadenopathy.  IMPRESSION:  Right breast: BI-RADS 1: Negative. Recommend annual mammogramthe right breast.  Left breast: BI-RADS 4C: High suspicion for malignancy. Irregular peripheral enhancement along the anterior, anterolateral, medial, and posterolateral aspect of the anterior portion of the seroma in the left breast at 12:00 is suspicious for residual disease. Differential diagnosis includes postoperative inflammation given recent lumpectomy. Recommend surgical consultation. 4 mm focus of enhancement in the left breast at 6:00 is mildly suspicious (4A). Recommend targeted ultrasound. If there is no sonographic correlate, recommend MRI guided biopsy.  04/30/2017 NM Sentinel node imaging of the left breast  FINDINGS:  Expected intense activity is noted at the injection site at the  left breast. 3 foci of tracer uptake in the left axilla,  compatible with 
 sentinel lymph nodes.    04/21/2017 Left Breast US Guided Biopsy, Left Post-Biopsy Mammogram  Pathology Results: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (see final pathology report). This was concordant with the imaging impression. Recommend surgical excision. Results, recommendations and plans for management were discussed with the patient by the Breast Health Center clinical nurse specialist. Patient to follow up with Dr ***** *****.    04/10/2017 Bilateral Digital Diagnostic Mammogram w/CAD, Left Breast Ultrasound Limited   BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM FINDINGS  The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. There is an irregular mass measuring 20 millimeters with spiculated margin in the left breast at 12 o'clock.This is best seen on the tomosynthesis views. The right breast appears unremarkable.  LEFT ULTRASOUND FINDINGS  A targeted ultrasound was performed of the left breast at 12 o'clock  located 2 centimeters from the nipple. Ultrasound is suggestive of a solid mass measuring 17 millimeters in the left breast at 12 o'clock located 2 centimeters from the nipple.This corresponds to the palpable finding of clinical concern.  IMPRESSION  Solid mass in the left breast is highly suggestive of malignancy.  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy is recommended. The referring physician was notified of these results by fax. The left axilla will be evaluated with ultrasound when the patient returns for biopsy. If there adenopathy, US guided core biopsy will be performed.    Assessment and Plan:        Patient Active Problem List   Diagnosis    Breast cancer, left breast   58 year old postmenopausal woman with a T2N1 grade 2 IDC with a reported Ki67 of 30% on her core biopsy.  HER2 was retested on the surgical sample and showed no gene amplification by FISH.  Long discussion of the pathology and the goal of therapy.  She did not understand the relationship between the cancer she currently has, her genetic testing 
 and the risk of distant recurrence. We discussed this at length.  She does not know if she has had expanded panel testing or BRCA testing only.    We also discussed her pathology report which shows a possible small area of positivity at the deep margin on the re-resection sample, as well as additional multifocal disease.  I believe that the fascia was removed, so this will be managed by radiation therapy.    Given the extent of her cancer, I would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy.  We will need to review her pathology and also discuss whether any additional node sampling is required or whether she can proceed to radiation without further surgery.  LIkely give the fact that she needs radiation already, the best approach will be radiation without further node sampling.    We discussed types of chemotherapy, her options include AC/weekly T or TC x 4 chemotherapy. Given recent data suggesting similar outcome in hormone receptor positive disease with these two regimens, and less toxicity with TC as well better hair preservation with scalp cooling - which is very important to her in particular.  I think it is reasonable to go with TC x 6 based on these recent studies.    We discussed scalp cooling and the risk of hair loss, which she also discussed with our scalp cooling coordinator.  She understands that this is not a guarantee for success.    She is most concerned about having a port, but understands that getting chemotherapy in her right arm with poor baseline access is not feasible.  We reviewed the port placement and what it will look like.    She is unhappy with her cosmesis in the left breast.  I explained that we have to wait for the area to be fully healed and that she could see a plastic surgeon before radiation to consider whether additional surgery would be useful.    Plan  Submit authorization for TC x 6 with ONPRO support  Referral for chemotherapy teaching, port placement  Staging with 
 PET/CT  Baseline echo although not receiving AC as planned so far  Start 07/09/17 with dignicap.    Path review (review Ki67)    Discuss cosmetics when the left breast is better healed.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects and nutrition reviewed in detail.  Total face to face time: 70  Total counseling time: 55
