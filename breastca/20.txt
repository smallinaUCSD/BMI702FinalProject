ID: ***** ***** is a 81 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    HPI: The patient last had a screening mammogram on 11/06/11 (at 76 years) which was notable for heterogeneously dense breast tissue, but no features of malignancy.  The patient felt a painful mass in her right breast in August 2016.  She presented to her PCP (Dr. *****) of 30+ years on 09/11/16 who noted a firm mobile mass (6 cm) in the right upper outer quadrant of her breast with dimpling of overlying skin.      A diagnostic mammogram on 09/17/16 demonstrated heterogeneously dense breast tissue and a round, indistinct, high density mass (4.1 x 3.3 cm) at the site of the palpable lump, which was in the upper outer right breast, posterior depth.  A targeted ultrasound at that time was notable for a hypoechoic irregular solid mass (2.7 x 2.9 x 3.8 cm) in the upper outer right breast, at the 10:00 position, 9 cm from the nipple.  She underwent a right breast fine needle aspiration at the 10:00 position on 09/17/16.  The pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma with ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative (IHC 0; FISH ratio 1.7).    She established care with Dr. ***** ***** on 09/25/16.  She was offered breast conserving surgery, but preferred mastectomy in an effort to avoid radiation.  ***** underwent a right breast simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 10/25/16 with Dr. *****.  The pathology was notable for 3.6 cm of grade 3 IDC.  The mitotic count was quite elevated at 74/10 hpf.  The final margins were negative.  Features suggestive of lymphovascular invasion were present.  No DCIS was present.  One of the 2 sentinel lymph nodes was positive for adenocarcinoma (1.2 cm, but no extranodal extension).  Biomarkers were notable for estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 positive (IHC 1; FISH ratio 2.1, 
 but with HER2 sig/nuc 3.0 and Cen17 sig/nuc 1.5), and variable Ki67 expression (<5% to 25-30%; average ~15%).      ***** developed dyspnea on the evening of 11/20/16 and presented to ***** ***** ***** in the context of her known congestive hart failure with left venrticular dysfunction (LVEF 25%).  She was managed with Lasix in the CDU and discharged earlier today.  She presents to clinic with her daughter (*****) and granddaughter (*****).  She feels much better today, back to her baseline with regards to energy and dyspnea.  She has no pain at the site of her breast surgery.

GROSS ABNORMALITIES: A firm, palpable, pink-white mass with irregular  borders (2.6 cm medial-to-lateral x 3 cm superior-to-inferior x 2.8 cm  anterior-to-posterior; spanning slices 5 through 8) is present at 10  o'clock, approximately 7 cm from the nipple. The inferior tip of slice  9 has a pink, dark-yellow area (1 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm) resembling a prior  biopsy site.    A small (0.5 cm greatest dimension) orange-yellow translucent bead is  identified in slice 10 within white, firm fibrous-appearing tissue. The  bead is wrapped in tissue paper and gauze and placed with the remainder  of slice 10 in the specimen container.    Margins:  -Anterior/superior: Mass is <0.1 cm from margin (slice 6 and 7).  -Anterior/inferior: Mass is 0.1 cm from margin (***** 7).  -Medial: Mass is 12 cm from margin.  -Lateral: Mass is 2.4 cm from margin  -Deep: Mass is 1.5 cm from margin (slice 8).  -Nipple base: Mass is 8.4 cm from nipple base.  -Skin: Mass is 2.5 cm from lateral skin ellipse tip.    There is no nipple retraction or crust. The skin has a blue discolored  area (0.7 cm) immediately adjacent to the areola grossly consistent with  a bruise. No scars are seen. The deep surface is smooth and appears  complete. The anterior surfaces have lobular 
 yellow adipose tissue.   The parenchyma uninvolved by the mass consist of mixed yellow adipose  tissue (70%) and white, firm tissue (30%). The specimen is radiographed  in the Pathology Department and a clip is not identified.    ***** *****/Pathology Resident  ***** *****/Pathologist    Electronically signed out on *****/*****/***** *****:*****      Addendum   Date Ordered:   10/31/2016   Status:  Signed Out    Date Complete:   10/31/2016   By: ***** *****    Date Reported:   10/31/2016     Addendum Diagnosis    Addendum Comment    Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2  and Ki-67 were performed by manual morphometry on block A4.    The test for estrogen receptors is negative. There is no nuclear  staining in tumor cells. Internal positive control is present, and  external positive control is appropriate.    The test for progesterone receptors is negative. There is no nuclear  staining in tumor cells. Internal positive control is present, and  external positive control is appropriate.    Result of HER2 test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2 oncoprotein  over-expression. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a  scale of 0-3.    Ki-67 proliferation index: Variable expression ranging from <5% to  25-30%. Overall, it is estimated to be ~15%.       Assessment and Recommendations:  81 y.o. postmenopausal patient with multiple medical comorbidities, including heart failure with LVEF 25% and DM II, who has recently been diagnosed with a Stage II (T2N1) triple negative breast cancer who requires additional testing before final recommendations can be made.    I discussed with the patient and her family the natural history of triple negative breast cancer.  We reviewed the available pathology and imaging reports.  I explained that chemotherapy is the only FDA approved treatment for triple negative breast cancer and that we generally provide chemotherapy to 
 patients with Stage II TNBC.  We then reviewed her multiple medical comorbidities and I stated great concern that our chemotherapy regimens would likely cause her great harm and that she would have a very difficult time tolerating them.  We discussed in brief the regimens of AC/T (which would not be safe in the context of her heart failure), TC (which would not be safe in the context of her heart failure due to fluid shifts as well as her diabetes due to use of dexamethasone), and finally CMF (although less toxic, still introducing great risk).    We discussed the likelihood of recurrence which is quite difficult to assess, but certainly notable in the context of a high grade, node positive, triple negative breast cancer.  We discussed recurrence as both a local and distant concept.      We discussed the role of staging imaging to assess for metastasis at this time.  She is interested in knowing whether or not her disease has already spread and believes she might want to consider a lower risk chemotherapy were she found to have metastasis.  I think that with regards to her other medical issues, it would be of prognostic value at this time to know whether or not she does have metastases. We will obtain a PET/CT and resume our conversation with regards to treatment at that time.     Recommendations in Brief:  - obtain PET/CT    I spent a total of 90 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 85 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, symptoms and therapeutic options.
