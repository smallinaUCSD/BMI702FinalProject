 two adjacent irregular masses with spiculated margins in the lower outer left breast, posterior depth, best seen on post gad axial image 77/***** and sagittal *****/*****, with a biopsy clip centered in each mass. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics.    2) Additionally, there is asymmetric non-mass enhancement extending medially from the two index masses, concerning for DCIS. The overall span of the two adjacent masses and NME measures 34 x 32 x 28 mm.    3) There is a 5 mm oval mass in the outer central left breast, anterior depth, best seen on post gad axial image 66/*****. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. This mass is approximately 2 cm anterosuperior to the index masses.    RIGHT Breast:  1) There are 2 adjacent foci in the upper outer right breast, anterior depth. One is 4mm and is best seen on post gad axial image 57/*****. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and plateau enhancement kinetics. The other is 3 mm and is best seen on post gad axial image 55/*****. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates medium initial rise and persistent enhancement kinetics.    2) There is a post biopsy clip in the outer central right breast, middle depth, site of biopsy proven sclerosing adenosis, which was sampled at an outside facility. There is non-mass enhancement just medial to the biopsy clip, best seen on post gad axial image 69/*****, which is likely represents the sclerosing adenosis.  01/11/17: start tamoxifen    01/18/17: start zoladex injection    February 2017: switch from tamoxifen to letrozole  March 2017: d/c letrozole and switch back to tamoxifen September 13 depression  04/09/17:  bilateral mastectomies and left slnb: path pending  November 2018: stopped tamoxifen, switch to OS/letrozole    December 2018: switched from letrozle to exemestane due to anxiety and emotional lability, cont zoladex locally monthly        
 Polycystic ovaries 12/26/2016     Last Assessment & Plan:   Long history of amenorrhea, in the last year, they have increased to almost monthly.  Now, increased pain with ovulation and periods, they are heavier and clotting.       Cyst of breast 06/16/2015     Last Assessment & Plan:   HISTORY/REASON FOR EXAM: 2 left breast lumps noted on self breast examination.  TECHNIQUE/EXAM DESCRIPTION: Unilateral LEFT digital diagnostic mammography was performed and interpreted with CAD, limited left breast ultrasound.  COMPARISON: 11/26/14 and 06/01/09.  FINDINGS:  3 views of the left breast were obtained.  The breast tissue is extremely dense.  There are is a large rounded benign-appearing nodule in the inferior medial periareolar region of the left breast at the site of one lump.  There is dense breast parenchyma in the lateral mid anterior portion of the left breast at the site of a second lump which was marked.  No spiculated mass or suspicious calcification is identified.  Limited left breast ultrasound: There is a large cyst containing one thin partial septation located at the 10:30 position 1 cm from the nipple measuring 3.9 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm. This accounts for one of the 2 palpable nodules.  There is a small simple cyst at the 3:00 position 3 cm from the nipple measuring 4.2 x 3.8 x 3.3 mm. This accounts for the second palpable nodule.  No solid nodule is present.  IMPRESSION:  1. 2 simple cysts in the left breast accounting for the palpable abnormalities.  2. Cyst aspiration of the larger cyst could be performed if pain persists.  3. If symptoms resolve routine bilateral followup mammography in November 2015 is recommended.  The results were given to the patient at the time of visit.      Mass of breast 05/12/2015     Last Assessment & Plan:   mammo done November 2014.      1. BREASTS ARE EXTREMELY DENSE, WHICH LOWERS SENSITIVITY OF MAMMOGRAPHY. NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY AND NO INTERVAL CHANGE.    2. SCREENING MAMMOGRAM 
 IN ONE YEAR IS RECOMMENDED.    Recently found a couple of lumps left breast.  No nipple discharge.  Some discomfort left breast      Neck pain 05/12/2015     Last Assessment & Plan:   Had a MVA last  *****.  Went to ***** ***** ***** for workup.  She recalls imaging as negative.  She continues to have neck pain radiating to left shoulder.  Underwent PT, this made it worse.  She is undergoing rolfing and would like to try some muscle relaxers to take prior to the sessions.  Numbness and tingling in left arm.  Her hand will shake with weight.  Her arm symptoms predated the MVA.  She was seen by the ***** for this complaint just before the MVA.       Anxiety disorder 01/12/2015       MEDICATIONS  Current Outpatient Medications   Medication Sig Dispense Refill    amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 875 mg tablet TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY UNTIL GONE  0    amoxicillin-clavulanate (AUGMENTIN) 875-125 mg tablet Take by mouth.      benzonatate (TESSALON) 200 mg capsule Take 200 mg by mouth.      buPROPion (WELLBUTRIN XL) 150 mg 24 hr tablet Take 150 mg by mouth.      doxycycline (VIBRA-TABS) 100 mg tablet TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY FOR 10 DAYS  0    exemestane (AROMASIN) 25 mg tablet TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY DAY FOR 30 DAYS  4    HYDROcodone-acetaminophen (NORCO) 5-325 mg tablet TAKE 1 TO 2 TABS BY MOUTH EVERY 6 HOURS AS NEEDED FOR PAIN *G89*  0    IBU 800 mg tablet TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY 8 HOURS AS NEEDED  3    metroNIDAZOLE (METROGEL) 0.75 % gel Apply thin film to affected area BID      ondansetron (ZOFRAN-ODT) 4 mg rapid dissolve tablet DISSOLVE 1 TAB ON THE TONGUE EVERY 6 HOURS AS NEEDED FOR NAUSEA/VOMITING  0     No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

Breast Cancer  -NED on exam  -Continue exemestane 25mg daily. We discussed continuing AI for at least 5 years.   -Recommend checking estradiol level to ensure ovarian suppression, if suppressed can check q3months  -needs DEXA scan now and every 2 years. If 
 osteopenia can consider adding bisphosphonate. Reviewed adjuvant bisphosphonate data showing reduced distant mets, improved BCSS, and OS for postmenopausal women and bisphosphonate use.   -she is considering BSO which is reasonable since she will likely be in natural menopause after 5 years of OS/AI.  -continue q6months exams, no imaging given bilateral mastectomies    2. Depression/Anxiety, improved  -Follow up with local psych for ongoing support as needed.      Follow-up in 6 months or sooner if she has new or worsening symptoms.     I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.    *****, ***** *****, am acting as a scribe for services provided by ***** ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** 11:46 AM      The above scribed documentation as annotated by me accurately reflects the services I have provided.   ***** ***** *****, MD  *****/*****/***** 11:51 AM
