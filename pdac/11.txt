I had the pleasure of seeing ***** ***** for follow up of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at our GI Medical Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.    Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** is a 74 y.o. male who initially presented to Dr. ***** on 10/30/15 with weight loss (8 lbs over past month), decline in appetite and difficulty in controlling his blood glucose levels.     On 11/02/15, a CT abdomen was obtained which revealed a 7.5x3.5x3.7cm mass in the tail of the pancreas with thrombosis of splenic vein and marked narrowing and encasement of the splenic artery. There was also mass effect on the proximal peroneal vein at the level of the portal confluence. Portal vein and splenic vein were noted to be narrowed but patent. Radiologist report notes that the mass abuts the superior mesenteric artery along its superior superficial margin as it traverses the pancreas. The loss of fat plane between mass and the antral region of the stomach was suspicious for Direction extension.     Subsequently, an EUS was performed on 11/08/15 which revealed the mass extending from the neck to the tail of the pancreas. Pancreatic ductal dilatation was noted. The mass noted to invade the muscularis propria of the stomach (T4 disease) and was noted to encase the splenic vessels. Due to difficulty in advancing the scope into the duodenum, further evaluation of portal vein, lymph nodes and uncinate process was not possible. However, a large lymph node measuring 2.7 cm was noted adjacent to the celiac axis. EUS staging was at least T4, N1. Cytopathology from the FNA of the pancreatic mass was consistent with adenocarcinoma.   He presented to a local urgent care and then ED on 11/12/15 with bilateral lower extremity weakness and slurred speech which lasted for approximately 20 minutes. It was noted that due to the abdominal and back pain he experienced after the biopsy, patient took marijuana  (smoked/ate) after which he was noted to have the symptoms of weakness and slurred speech.     He saw Dr. ***** on 11/14/15 who recommended systemic treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel and referred the patient to Dr. ***** for potential surgical evaluation. During that visit on November 17, a diagnostic laparoscopy was recommended.     He was seen in our clinic on 11/21/15 when we recommended initiation of systemic therapy with mFOLFIRINOX.    12/05/15: Cycle 1, Day 1 of mFOLFIRINOX (20% dose reduction in irinotecan)    01/03/16: BLE Doppler Ultrasound- Negative for DVT    01/31/16: C5D1 - Admitted from the infusion center after developing dyspnea and chest tightness while receiving irinotecan. In the ED, he was noted to be in afib, CTA neg for PE. Discharged on 02/01/16.     05/14/16: Cycle 12 of mFOLFIRINOX     05/28/2016: Began treatment holiday    Interval History:  *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/***** Presented to the ED with worsening abdominal pain: CT scan showing tumor in pancreatic body/tail causing mass effect on the small intestine in the region of the ligament of Treitz, resulting in partial bowel obstruction. In addition, the CT imaging demonstrates carcinomatosis with peritoneal and omental implants. During this admission, hepatobiliary performed EGD with 5 overlapping stents placed across the malignant duodenal obstruction, with evidence of carcinomatosis of the jejunum as well. A CT scan demonstrated resolution of the intestinal obstruction s/p stent placement, lack of pneumobilia in left biliary system, and moderate ascites from prior. Hepatobiliary does not believe that his discomfort is related to the stents, though he may have free flow of fluid and gas from the more distal small bowel retrograde through the stented intestine as the stents cause lack of normal peristalsis. In addition, it is possible he may have some discomfort from the stent causing back pain (part of the duodenum is retroperitoneal).     08/25/2016: 
 Patient had an NG tube placed    Patient's family presents today with patient simultaneously undergoing xray imaging of his small bowel as an inpatient at *****. His recent CT imaging is most notable for small bowel obstruction. His bilirubin was 3.5mg/dL on 08/24/16. His family voiced some concerns about transitioning the patient to palliative care as he reportedly is still very alert and sentient. They expressed interest in trying to transition him from an NG tube to a blended diet and attempt one final treatment regimen.     Review of Systems  General: no recent fevers or chills.

Adrenal Glands:  Unchanged indeterminate 9 mm nodule in each adrenal gland. Kidneys:   mild left hydroureteronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** is a 74 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with concern for metastatic disease. He was started on systemic therapy with ***** on 12/05/15.  His restaging scans following 4 cycles of chemotherapy were concerning for metastatic disease that is responding to treatment. His CT chest obtained prior to initiation of chemotherapy had revealed nonspecific pulmonary nodules which decreased in size with chemotherapy raising the concern for metastatic involvement. In addition, there were liver lesions noted on the CT abdomen but it was hard to interpret these 
 as the comparison scans were from October (1 month prior to initiation of chemotherapy). His restaging scans from 03/21/16 showed continued treatment response with decrease in the size of the pancreatic mass and the hepatic lesions appearing less conspicuous.  He completed C12 of mFOLFIRINOX on 05/16/2016 and the restaging scans from his last visit revealed stable disease in the pancreatic mass.    On 05/28/2016, he chose to take a treatment holiday vs beginning clinical trial A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of FOLFIRINOX Followed by Ipilimumab in Combination with Allogeneic GM-CSF Transfected Pancreatic Tumor Vaccine in the Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer". Unfortunately, he progressed while on chemotherapy holiday and traveling in ***** as seen on his restaging scans which showed interval disease progression since 05/27/2016, with increased size and infiltration of the pancreatic body/tail mass resulting in new partial bowel obstruction at the ligament of Treitz. New peritoneal and omental nodularity associated with small volume ascites is concerning for progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis; worsening porta hepatis soft tissue infiltration resulting in new biliary obstruction, with moderate right and left-sided intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. He underwent ERCP with stent placement by Dr. ***** on 08/24/16.     At this time, his most recent bilirubin was 3.5mg/dL on 08/24/16 and his 08/25/16 CT imaging is most notable for small bowel obstruction. Given these findings, chemotherapy will likely do more harm than good. We therefore discussed the next best step as palliative care. There is a slight possibility of resuming systemic therapy if his obstruction, bilirubin and oral intake improve which is quite unlikely. I briefly discussed the prognosis of the patient's disease with his family. We further discussed the results of his same day xray of his small bowel which was pending at the time. This showed 
 continued blockage despite stent placement which likely represents functional bowel obstruction as opposed to structural obstruction making further stent placement unlikely to help.     Plan, in brief:  - Continue to follow his PO, obstruction, Bilirubin and Liver function  - Follow up on full report of Xray imaging to the small bowel to determine his ability to undergo additional stent placement.  - Anticipate the need to transition the patient to hospice whether he can undergo further stent placement or not.   - Follow up with the patient on the phone directly    I spent a total of 35 minutes face-to-face with the patient's family, over half of that time in direct counseling regarding the patient's cancer diagnosis.
