In March 2018, and an ERCP and stent was placed.    04/01/2018: Underwent a Whipple for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in *****. Experienced postoperative complications of internal bleeding that required an additional laparotomy. He had direct invasion of the tumor into the duodenum and 6 of 25 lymph nodes were positive. Postoperatively, he also had a small bowel obstruction which was relieved by nasogastric suction. He had a port placed but this was removed as it became infected and he also experienced sepsis with klebsiella. This was treated with Cipro.    05/25/18: New baseline CT CAP reveals evidence of new liver metastases    06/05/18: C1D1 FOLFIRINOX.  CA 19-9 was 17,090.  06/12/18: Presented to UCSF ED with fever of 38.3 C. CT was negative for any acute findings, but did reveal worsening metastatic disease to liver. CXR clear and UA negative.   06/21/18: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX   07/05/18: C3D1. CA 19-9 was 21,247.  07/19/18: C4D1  08/01/18: CT CAP reveals decrease in size of hepatic mets, interval increase in pancreatic ductal dilatation.   08/02/18: C5D1. CA 19-9 dropped to 6,040.  08/16/18: C6D1  08/30/18: C7D1. CA 19-9 was 1,909.  09/13/18: C8D1  09/26/18: CT CAP reveals slight increase in the size of liver mets. However, given that his CA 19-9 continued to drop and patient is asymptomatic, Dr. ***** decided to continue him on FOLFIRINOX.    10/03/18: C9D1. CA 19-9 further dropped to 789.   10/18/18: C10D1  11/01/18: C11D1. CA 19-9 = 839  11/15/18: C12D1  11/24/18:  CT CAP indicates disease progression. CA 19-9 =

Radiographic data:   No recent imaging reviewed    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   In summary, Mr. ***** is a 71 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, status post resection, now with new metastatic disease.    #pancreatic adenocarcinoma  He was most recently progressed on FOLFIRINOX, and has since started 2nd line therapy with Gemcitabine + Abraxane on 11/29/18.    His labs and PS are acceptable and he agrees to proceed with C2D1 Gem/Abrax. We discussed the possibility of having to reduce his Abraxane dose in the future if his peripheral neuropathy worsens. Given that he has grade 1 neuropathy at this point, no dose modifications are indicated. His labs and PS are acceptable and he will proceed with C2D1 today. CT scan due after he completes cycle 2.     #Nausea/vomiting: Improved  - 
 Likely June 24 chemotherapy   - Premed with Aloxi & Emend.   - On day 3 patient will apply granisetron patch 3.1 mg/24 hours, and take compazine PRN.   - IV hydration on additional days 3 & 11 PRN   - Patient will also continue to use cannabis product.     #pancreatic enzyme insufficiency   - Continue Creon 2 tab/meal and 1 tab/snacks    #SPINK1 gene mutation: SPINK1: c.101A>G  - Patient is a carrier, but does not have SPINK1-related risks that are due to having TWO mutations. His family needs to be screened for SPINK1 which is classically a gene and some familial pancreatitis but also leads to pancreatic cancer.    #R UE tremor & bilateral foot drop L>R: resolved  - EMG on 09/15/18 to evaluate foot drop revealed the following:   "evidence for bilateral, predominantly demyelinating peroneal neuropathies across the fibular head...Demyelinating peroneal neuropathies at the fibular head can be seen in patients who frequently cross their legs, particularly after a period of weight loss (as is the case in this patient)"  - Followed by his PCP, Dr. *****.   - Continue to monitor    RETURN TO CLINIC: 2 weeks    As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.    I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the symptoms, treatment plan, risks and/or therapeutic options for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****, NP
