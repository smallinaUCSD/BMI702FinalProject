PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Mr. ***** is a 53 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with biopsy-proven oligo metastatic disease in the abdominal wall.    ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   He first presented with abdominal pain and weight loss. On 01/10/2019, he had a CT of the abdomen which showed a mass in the pancreas which encased the celiac axis along with a concerning soft tissue nodule in the abdominal wall at midline.      02/06/19: CT PET showed a hypermetabolically active large pancreatic tail mass abutting adjacent structures, although the lesion in the abdominal wall was slightly PET avid (SUV 1.2).     01/22/19: EUS directed FNA of the pancreatic lesion revealed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, MSS.    02/14/19: Biopsy of abdominal wall nodule showed metastatic adenocarcinoma.    03/08/19: Patient presented for C1D1 FOLFIRINOX and labs revealed hyperbilirubinemia (t bili 1.7). Per patient report, he has h/o hyperbilirubinemia and diagnosed ~2 years ago with possible Gilbert syndrome. Irinotecan was held and he proceeded with C1D1 FOLFOX.    03/19/19: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX. T bili was 0.8. Dr. ***** recommended that patient proceed with Irinotecan and closely follow patient for possible irinotecan toxicities.   04/02/19: C3D1 FOLFIRINOX    04/30/19: C4D1 FOLFIRINOX    05/15/19: CT CAP showed stable pancreatic mass and slight decreased size of anterior abdominal wall lesion  05/16/19: C5D1 FOLFIRINOX    05/18/19: US with doppler LE revealed segmental occlusive thrombi within the superior and mid duplicated left peroneal veins. Patient started on xarelto.   05/28/19: C6D1 FOLFIRINOX. CA 19-9 = 2,528    06/11/19: C7D1 FOLFIRINOX    06/25/19: C8D1 FOLFIRINOX. CA 19-9 = 995    07/06/19: CT CAP shows continued 
 response to treatment   07/09/19: C9D1 FOLFIRINOX    07/11/19: CA 19-9 = 588  07/25/19: Treatment held (Cycle 10) d/t thrombocytopenia (PLT 95)  08/01/19: C10D1 FOLFIRINOX. CA 19-9 = 826  08/13/19: C11D1 FOLFIRINOX    09/03/19: C12D1 FOLFIRINOX  (Last cycle)  09/10/19: CT CAP stable disease in the pancreas and abdominal wall lesion. Patient was recommended to start chemotherapy break.     10/03/19: Per patient's request, his case was presented at Pancreas Tumor Board to see if he is a candidate for surgical resection. His pancreas mass is not resectable for multiple reasons, primarily because of extensive vessel involvement and encasement. Dr. ***** ***** recommended consolidation radiation due to the fact that his pancreas tumor is abutting the stomach and concerns over the complications that this will likely lead to. However, Dr. ***** does not recommend radiation therapy at this time since patient is asymptomatic.     INTERVAL HISTORY:   ***** has been feeling generally well. Continues to have some oral thrush. Started fluconazole today. Was also seen by dermatologist recently and started on cicloprox cream for tinea cruris in groin area.
