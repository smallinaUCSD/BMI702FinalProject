REASON FOR VISIT/CC:   Chief Complaint   Patient presents with    Follow-up     IDENTIFICATION:   64 y.o. male with resected pancreatic cancer    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   ***** ***** ***** presents today for evaluation of his resected pancreatic cancer. His oncologic history is reviewed here:     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ***** ***** is a 62 year old male,   History notable for type II DM, w  03/19/17 he presented to ***** with 3 weeks of painless jaundice and acholic stools. He was found to have transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and a mass at the pancreatic head.   03/26/17, the patient had an endoscopic US, stent placement in the stricture at the CBD, and a biopsy/brushings taken.   "-A mass was identified in the pancreatic head. Fine needle aspiration performed with atypical cells seen but otherwise official results pending.  -Hyperechoic material consistent with sludge was visualized ***** in the gallbladder.  -There was no evidence of significant pathology in the visualized portion of the liver."  03/30/17, the stent was replaced in the setting of upward trending total bilirubin. Biopsy from 03/26/17 revealed adenocarcinoma, and a CT abd/pelvis and chest shows stage 3 local advancement without evidence of distant metastasis.   04/13/17: ***** ***** Surgical Eval.    04/20/17: ***** surgical eval.     06/03/17: C1D1 neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX   10/20/17: CT scan: Stable, no e/o progression   11/05/17: Cycle 12 FOLFIRINOX (Final cycle)  01/25/18: Whipple with Dr. *****. Completed pancreatico-duodenectomy with pancreatico-jejunostomy, and per op report, mass was adherent to the portal vein. Pathology revealed 4.6cm pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with +PNI, +SM at the SMA margin with 11/46 lymph nodes positive. His postoperative course was complicated by a wound infection in his left neck incision and he was discharged to a SNF where he required 1 month of rehab and was discharged home on 03/24/18.  04/15/18: 
 CT CAP reports ill defined stranding in surgical resection bed consistent with recurrence or post-surgical changes with significant portal vein anastamosis narrowing. No evidence of metastatic disease.  04/21/18: Consultation with Dr. *****. He presented TB's recommendations: Given patient's high risk of recurrence with + margins at the SMA and many LNs involved, it was recommended that patient receive XRT and then systemic therapy   05/04/18: Consultation with Dr. *****. Recommendations: Repeat PET/CT prior to start of radiotherapy. IMRT auth submitted, anticipate 28 fractions - plan for CT sim in ~2 weeks after resolution of C dificile infection. Return to clinic in 2 weeks for further discussion with same day sim.    May 2018: Patient developed ascites and has required weekly paracentesis. Ascites fluid is negative for malignancy and not KRAS mutated. Ascites likley related to CT finding of portal vein stenosis, which is likely from surgery; no evidence of thrombus.   June 2018: Portal vein stented. Improvement in Ascites.   September 08: Neg PET CT  October 08: neg abd U/s, no ascites.     accompanied by Daughter ***** ***** today.  He's doing pretty weel..

Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD  Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging    Path from surgery :  Service Date: 01/25/2018  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS  A. Soft tissue, "superior mesenteric artery margin," biopsy:   Adenocarcinoma; see comment.   B. Celiac lymph node, biopsy: Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one lymph  node (March 22).  C. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Mild chronic cholecystitis.  D. Spleen, splenectomy:   1. Spleen (564 grams) with no significant pathologic abnormality.  2. No tumor in two lymph nodes (0/2).    E. Pancreas, tail and body, distal pancreatectomy:  1. Ductal adenocarcinoma; see comment.   2. Chronic pancreatitis, extensive.   3. No tumor in twenty-six lymph nodes (0/26).       F. Pancreas, duodenum, portal vein, pancreaticoduodenectomy:  1. Ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately-differentiated, 4.6 cm, involving  duodenal wall; see comment  2. Chronic pancreatitis, extensive.   3. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, high-grade.   4. Adenocarcinoma in ten lymph nodes (January 06).    COMMENT:  PANCREAS SYNOPTIC COMMENT  - Tumor Location: Pancreatic head.  - Procedure: Pancreaticoduodenectomy.  - Size: Unifocal, 4.6 cm.  - Histologic Type: Ductal adenocarcinoma (slides F1, F4, F5, and  F8-F15).  - Histologic Grade of Invasive Carcinoma: Moderately-differentiated  (status post treatment).  - Microscopic 
 Tumor Extension: Tumor invades duodenum and tunica media  of portal vein.     - Lymphovascular Invasion: Not identified.  - Perineural Invasion: Present.  - Margins:    Superior mesenteric artery margin: In the separately submitted "SMA  margin" (part A) invasive adenocarcinoma is present on permanent and  deeper level sections performed on block A1. Adenocarcinoma was not  present on the slides evaluated for frozen section diagnosis.     Uncinate (Retroperitoneal) Margin: For the pancreaticoduodenectomy  specimen (part F), invasive carcinoma is less than 0.1 cm from  cauterized margin on slide F5.   Bile Duct Margin: Negative for invasive carcinoma and high-grade  dysplasia, invasive carcinoma is 0.5 cm from margin.  Portal Vein Margin: Both the superior and inferior portal vein margins  are negative for invasive carcinoma. Invasive carcinoma is 0.8 cm from  the superior portal vein margin and 2.3 cm from the inferior portal vein  margin.   Pancreatic Neck Margin: For the pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen (part  F), the pancreatic neck margin is positive for invasive adenocarcinoma  on slide F1. For the distal pancreatectomy specimen (part E), a focus of  invasive carcinoma is present at the proximal pancreatic margin.  Correlation with operative findings is recommended to determine if  either of these represents a true surgical margin.   Proximal Intestinal Margin: Negative for invasive carcinoma, invasive  carcinoma is 6 cm from the margin.  Distal Intestinal Margin (Distal Duodenal or Jejunal): Negative for  invasive carcinoma, invasive carcinoma is 9 cm from the margin.  - Posterior pancreatic surface: Negative, invasive carcinoma is 0.1 cm  from this surface on slide F13.   - Anterior pancreatic surface: Negative, invasive carcinoma is 1 cm  from this surface on slide F12.  - Treatment Effect: Residual tumor on slides E1, F1, F4, F5, and  F8-F16.    Evans grading system (grade I-IV): 
 Grade I, little (<10%) or no  tumor cell destruction.     Modified Ryan scheme for tumor regression (score 0-3): Score 3,  poor or no response (extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor  regression).  - Regional Lymph Nodes: Positive.    Total number of positive nodes: 11.    Nodes involved by direct extension: 4.     Total number of nodes examined: 46.  - Other Pathologic Findings: Chronic pancreatitis, extensive;  pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, high grade.   AJCC 8th Edition Pathologic Stage: ypT3N2.    Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA  mismatch repair protein expression on block F11. The results in the  tumor cell nuclei are:  MLH1 expression: Present.   PMS2 expression: Present.  MSH2 expression: Present.  MSH6 expression: Present.  05/20/18: Ascites cell block interpreted as benign, and negative for KRAS mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4.     Assessment    Impression: 64 y.o. male with resected PDAC, pT2N3, + superior mesenteric artery margin.    Plan:  1. Resected Pancreatic Cancer.  Positive margins and high risk for recurrence now with rising markers.   Recheck Ca19-9 this week.   CT in 2 weeks  RTC with me post-above.     2. Nutrition   - continue creon  3. LE edema and abdominal distension:  Improved.      4 Diabetes: poor control.  Refer to new PMD if current health plan allows it  The patient understands and is in agreement with the plan; he knows to contact me before his next scheduled visit should any concerning symptoms arise in the interim.  I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 25 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan and symptoms'
