Interval slightly decreased size of hypodense 0.7 x 0.7 cm lesion in segment 6 (series 7 image 49), previously 1.1 x 0.8 cm. Interval slightly decreased size of ill-defined nodule along the inferior hepatic margin, now measuring 1.3 x 0.9 cm compared to 1.5 x 1.2 cm previously with new central hypodensity (series 7 image 56). Gallbladder: Unremarkable Spleen:  No significant change in hypodense splenic lesions. Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable Kidneys:  Hypodense renal mass(es) too small to characterize, either benign or clinically insignificant, unchanged. GI Tract:  Small paraesophageal hernia. Vasculature:  Unremarkable Lymphadenopathy: Absent Peritoneum: Unchanged 1.4 x 1.2 cm nodule in the right paracolic gutter (series 7 image 72). Slightly increased size of left paracolic gutter nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.0 cm, previously 1.1 x 0.9 cm (series 7 image 64). 
 Similar anterior left upper quadrant nodule measuring 1.1 x 0.9 cm, previously 1.1 x 1.0 cm (series 7 image 43). Previously described peritoneal implant in the lesser curvature the stomach is less conspicuous, but likely unchanged in size. Bladder: Unremarkable Reproductive organs: Unremarkable Bones:  No suspicious lesions Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable Lines/drains/medical devices: None     1.  Compared to 12/18/2018, no significant change in multicystic distal pancreas mass with slightly decreased size of hepatic lesions, no significant change in splenic lesions, and stable to slightly increased peritoneal implants. 2.  Increase in now moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation in the left hepatic lobe without a clear obstructing lesion. 3.  Unchanged chronic occlusion of the splenic vein and tumor encasement of the splenic artery.     Result Date: 02/15/2019  CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST
T8	SectionSkip 8708 9511	FINDINGS: LUNGS: Unchanged left lower lobe nodule measuring 3 mm (series 2 ***** 123); on the most remote prior in 2018 this nodule measured 6 mm. New patchy peribronchial vascular groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe (series 2 ***** 167). Unchanged right middle lobe scarring and calcified granulomata. PLEURA: No pleural effusion. MEDIASTINUM: No lymphadenopathy. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and postsurgical changes status post CABG BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious osseous lesions.     1. Unchanged left lower lobe nodule, decrease in size compared to most remote prior, possibly inflammatory versus treated metastasis. 2.

T9	SectionSkip 9513 13294	FINDINGS:  Inferior Chest: The heart is enlarged in size. No pericardial  effusion. There is a small left pleural effusion. Patchy ground-glass  and airspace opacities in the inferior right middle lobe and left lung  base, may 
 represent atelectasis versus infection. The lung bases are  clear.    Liver: Liver is normal in size and smooth in contour. Circumscribed  subcentimeter hyperdensities in the caudate lobe and inferior right  hepatic lobe, too small to accurately characterize. There is an ill  defined contour deforming hypodense lesion in the inferior right  hepatic lobe measuring approximately 1.4 cm in diameter (axial image  55). Portal and hepatic veins are patent.    Gallbladder and biliary tree: The gallbladder appears unremarkable.  There is prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation predominantly  involving the left hepatic lobe. The common bile duct appears normal in  caliber.    Pancreas/spleen: There is an ill defined mixed solid and cystic mass  involving the tail of the pancreas associated with few coarse  calcifications, measuring approximately 7.2 cm AP by 5.4 cm transverse  by 5.6 cm craniocaudal. This mass abuts the splenic hilum with  multiple cystic spaces within the spleen and loss of fat plane,  suggestive of direct invasion. Large wedge-shaped areas of  hypoenhancement within the peripheral aspects of spleen suggestive of  multiple splenic infarcts. There is loss of fat plane between the  pancreatic mass in the posterior wall of the stomach suggestive of  possible direct invasion.    Adrenals: The right adrenal gland appears unremarkable. There is mild  diffuse thickening of the left adrenal gland without definite focal  nodularity. Subtle loss of fat plane between the left adrenal gland  and pancreatic tail mass (axial image 55).    Kidneys: Bilateral subcentimeter hypodensities, too small to  accurately characterize but statistically likely to represent benign  cysts.The left kidney appears slightly inferior displaced. There is a  loss of fat plane between the anterior aspect of the left kidney and a  pancreatic tail mass (axial image 64). No nephrolithiasis or  hydronephrosis.    GI tract: There 
 is mucosal hyperenhancement involving the distal aspect  of the stomach adjacent to likely direct invasion from pancreatic mass.  There is associated wall thickening/ edema. Proximal stomach is  distended with fluid and food material. Findings concerning for at  least partial gastric outlet obstruction. There is mild wall edema of  the visualized distal esophagus. Small bowel loops are grossly normal  in course in caliber with no significant wall thickening or dilatation.  There is wall thickening involving the transverse colon, and descending  colon, and sigmoid colon. In the region of the splenic flexure, there  is loss of fat plane between the ill defined pancreatic tail mass and  the colon.    Bladder: Urinary bladder appears unremarkable.    Reproductive organs: The prostate gland is mildly prominent in size  measuring 4.6 x 4.2 x 4.5 cm.    Peritoneal Cavity: There is a small amount of free fluid noted in the  abdomen in the perihepatic space, perisplenic space, bilateral  paracolic gutters, and pelvis. No free air is identified. No  retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.    Vasculature: Scattered atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal  aorta and its main branches with no hemodynamically significant  stenosis or occlusion.    Bones and Soft tissues: No acute osseous abnormality. Multilevel  degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral  sacroiliac joints. Very small fat containing left inguinal hernia.  There is mild anasarca of the subcutaneous tissues. Few foci of air in  the right anterior abdominal wall, likely representing recent injection.

Vascular-venous: 1)  MPV is not involved. 2)  SMV is not involved. 3)  Thrombus in vein:  absent 4)  Venous collateral: None. 5)  Other: No change in chronic occlusion of the splenic vein. Visualized lung bases:  For chest findings, please see the separately dictated report from the CT of the chest of the same date. Liver:  Increased, now moderate to severe intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the left hepatic lobe. Interval slightly decreased size of hypodense 0.7 x 0.7 cm lesion in segment 6 (series 7 image 49), previously 1.1 x 0.8 cm. Interval slightly decreased size of ill-defined nodule along the inferior hepatic margin, now measuring 1.3 x 0.9 cm compared to 1.5 x 1.2 cm previously with new central hypodensity (series 7 image 56). Gallbladder: Unremarkable Spleen:  No significant change in hypodense splenic lesions. Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable Kidneys:  Hypodense renal mass(es) too small to characterize, either benign or clinically insignificant, unchanged. GI Tract:  Small paraesophageal hernia. Vasculature:  Unremarkable Lymphadenopathy: Absent Peritoneum: Unchanged 1.4 x 1.2 cm nodule in the right paracolic gutter (series 7 image 72). Slightly increased size of left paracolic gutter nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.0 cm, previously 1.1 x 0.9 cm (series 7 image 64). Similar anterior left upper quadrant nodule measuring 1.1 x 0.9 cm, previously 1.1 x 1.0 cm (series 7 image 43). Previously described peritoneal implant in the lesser curvature the stomach is less conspicuous, but likely unchanged in size. Bladder: Unremarkable Reproductive organs: Unremarkable Bones:  No suspicious lesions Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable Lines/drains/medical devices: None     1.  Compared to 12/18/2018, no significant change in multicystic distal pancreas mass with slightly decreased size of hepatic lesions, no significant change in splenic lesions, and stable to slightly increased peritoneal implants. 2.  Increase in now moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation in the left hepatic lobe without a clear obstructing lesion. 3.  Unchanged chronic occlusion of the splenic vein and tumor encasement of the splenic artery.     Result Date: 02/15/2019  CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST   FINDINGS: LUNGS: Unchanged left lower lobe nodule measuring 3 mm (series 2 ***** 123); on the most remote prior in 2018 this nodule measured 6 mm. New patchy peribronchial vascular groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe (series 2 ***** 167). Unchanged right middle lobe scarring and calcified granulomata. PLEURA: No pleural effusion. MEDIASTINUM: No lymphadenopathy. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and postsurgical changes status post CABG BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious osseous lesions.     1. Unchanged left lower lobe nodule, decrease in size compared to most remote prior, possibly inflammatory versus treated metastasis. 2. New patchy groundglass left lower lobe mild opacities, likely infectious.       Result Date: 03/11/2019 (outside)  CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  FINDINGS:  Inferior Chest: The heart is enlarged in size. No pericardial  effusion. There is a small left pleural effusion. Patchy ground-glass  and airspace opacities in the inferior right middle lobe and left lung  base, may represent atelectasis versus infection. The lung bases are  clear.    Liver: Liver is normal in size and smooth in contour. Circumscribed  subcentimeter hyperdensities in the caudate lobe and inferior right  hepatic lobe, too small to accurately characterize. There is an ill  defined contour deforming hypodense lesion in the inferior right  hepatic lobe measuring approximately 1.4 cm in diameter (axial image  55). Portal and hepatic veins are patent.    Gallbladder and biliary tree: The gallbladder appears unremarkable.  There is prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation predominantly  involving the left hepatic lobe. The common bile duct appears normal in  caliber.    Pancreas/spleen: There is an ill defined mixed solid and cystic mass  involving the tail of the pancreas associated with few coarse  calcifications, measuring approximately 7.2 cm AP by 5.4 cm transverse  by 5.6 cm craniocaudal. This mass abuts the splenic hilum with  multiple cystic spaces within the spleen and loss of fat plane,  suggestive of direct invasion. Large wedge-shaped areas of  hypoenhancement within the peripheral aspects of spleen suggestive of  multiple splenic infarcts. There is loss of fat plane between the  pancreatic mass in the posterior wall of the stomach suggestive of  possible direct invasion.    Adrenals: The right adrenal gland appears unremarkable. There is mild  diffuse thickening of the left adrenal gland without definite focal  nodularity. Subtle loss of fat plane between the left adrenal gland  and pancreatic tail mass (axial image 55).    Kidneys: Bilateral subcentimeter hypodensities, too small to  accurately characterize but statistically likely to represent benign  cysts.The left kidney appears slightly inferior displaced. There is a  loss of fat plane between the anterior aspect of the left kidney and a  pancreatic tail mass (axial image 64). No nephrolithiasis or  hydronephrosis.    GI tract: There is mucosal hyperenhancement involving the distal aspect  of the stomach adjacent to likely direct invasion from pancreatic mass.  There is associated wall thickening/ edema. Proximal stomach is  distended with fluid and food material. Findings concerning for at  least partial gastric outlet obstruction. There is mild wall edema of  the visualized distal esophagus. Small bowel loops are grossly normal  in course in caliber with no significant wall thickening or dilatation.  There is wall thickening involving the transverse colon, and descending  colon, and sigmoid colon. In the region of the splenic flexure, there  is loss of fat plane between the ill defined pancreatic tail mass and  the colon.    Bladder: Urinary bladder appears unremarkable.    Reproductive organs: The prostate gland is mildly prominent in size  measuring 4.6 x 4.2 x 4.5 cm.    Peritoneal Cavity: There is a small amount of free fluid noted in the  abdomen in the perihepatic space, perisplenic space, bilateral  paracolic gutters, and pelvis. No free air is identified. No  retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.    Vasculature: Scattered atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal  aorta and its main branches with no hemodynamically significant  stenosis or occlusion.    Bones and Soft tissues: No acute osseous abnormality. Multilevel  degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral  sacroiliac joints. Very small fat containing left inguinal hernia.  There is mild anasarca of the subcutaneous tissues. Few foci of air in  the right anterior abdominal wall, likely representing recent injection.    IMPRESSION:  1. Ill defined mixed solid and cystic pancreatic tail mass with few  coarse calcifications, measuring at least 7.2 x 5.4 x 5.6 cm. There is  direct invasion of the spleen and posterior stomach. There is also  questionable direct invasion of the splenic flexure of colon common the  left adrenal gland, and the left kidney.  2. Proximal gastric distension. Diffuse gastric wall edema with  mucosal hyperenhancement of the distal stomach, compatible with direct  invasion from adjacent pancreatic tail mass causing at least partial  gastric outlet obstruction.  3. Multiple peripheral wedge-shaped areas of hypoenhancement throughout  the spleen compatible with multiple splenic infarcts.  4. Diffuse wall edema of the transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon.  Possible direct invasion from pancreatic tail mass at the level of the  splenic flexure. Other possibilities include colitis of infectious or  inflammatory etiologies.  5. Small left pleural effusion. Patchy ground-glass and airspace  opacities in the inferior right middle lobe and left lung base,  possibly representing atelectasis versus infiltrate/infection.  6. Ill defined contour deforming hypodense lesion within the inferior  right hepatic lobe measuring 1.4 cm, concerning for metastatic disease  in this clinical setting.  7. Small volume diffuse abdominal ascites
