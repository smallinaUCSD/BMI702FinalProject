Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized because you had a fall with a fracture of 
your skull and some bleeding around your brain. You were seen by 
the neurosurgeons who did not feel that you needed surgery but 
recommended that you take Keppra for 10 days to prevent 
seizures. You were also seen by the ENT doctors who recommended 
that you take the following precautions to prevent a leak of the 
fluid around your brain: keeping the head of your bed elevated, 
taking stool softeners, sneezing with your mouth open, and not 
blowing your nose. They also recommended that you use ofloxacin 
0.3% drops in your ears to prevent an infection. You should keep 
your ear canal dry by placing a cotton ball in the ear canal and 
putting vaseline on the outside of the cotton ball and ear canal 
when you wash your hair. 

On your last day in the hospital, your blood pressures was low 
so we cut back your blood pressure medications.  Please stop 
taking these medications until you are evaluated by the 
prescribing doctor or another healthcare provider.

As you know, drinking alcohol in large quantities is detrimental 
for your health and may lead to death.  We recommend that you 
refrain from drinking and seek professional care to remain 
sober, as abstinence is essential to avoid further injury and 
detriment (including death) from alcohol.

Finally, if you should have any signs or symptoms of alcohol 
withdrawal (tremors, confusion, hallucinations), be sure to go 
directly to a local emergency room.

Duplex evaluation was performed of the left upper extremity 
surgical AV 
fistula.  Brachial artery is patent.  Draining vein is filled 
with thrombus. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Occluded left upper extremity AV fistula graft 
including the 
draining vein 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with hx TIDM,gastroparesis, HTN and ESRD (HD ___ 
presenting with clotted left UE AV fistula clot.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# CLOTTED FISTULA: Patient did not palpate thrills in her 
fistula and had experienced some difficulty with dialysis in the 
past two weeks.  ___ were consulted and patient underwent a stent 
placement to maintain patency of stent.  Fistulograms were done 
pre and post-stent placement to ensure that the clot was removed 
and vessel was patent.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
 
#DM: Patient has type one diabetes on insulin (glargine 14 units 
at breakfast and insulin sliding scale). Patient's blood glucose 
was low (59) in ED and received 12.5mg IV dextrose .  She was 
managed in-house with a gentle insulin sliding scale

# HTN: Patient not currently on any medications. BP controlled 
off medications. Has not been compliant in the past with meds. 
SBP was 195 in ED but has come down to 150s.  Labile blood 
pressures likely due to missing dialysis.  She was discharged on 
captopril 12.5mg BID (dose which her PCP had placed her on 
initially)

# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's admission potassium 5.9.  Likely due 
to lack of dialysis. EKG changes of peaked T-waves in V2 and 
patient asymptomatic. Patient has received one dose of calcium 
gluconate and kayexalate 30mg and K levels normalised after 
dialysis.
 
# ESRD: Patient on HD. Patient received one dose of HD in-house 
as patient missed most recent dose.  Nephrocaps were also 
continued in-house.

Imaging: 
- ___ CXR (___): The chest is normal except for healed rib
fractures on the right.  There is no interval change
- ___ Intra-Op Cholangiogram (___): Opacification of the
intrahepatic biliary ductal system, probably both right and left
intrahepatic ducts, as well as dilation of a tubular structure
more inferiorly that was initially read as the common bile duct. 

Further review indicates that in addition to the common bile
duct, this also could be a dilated left intrahepatic duct
projecting inferiorly due to obliquity
- ___ MRCP (___): Common hepatic duct and proximal CBD not seen
and there is dilatation of the left greater than right
intrahepatic biliary ductal system, with postsurgical
inflammatory changes within the operative bed as well as
perihepatic fluid.
- ___ EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular 
response,
Nonspecific ST abnormality, ST less depressed in Anterior leads

of
previous sphincterotomy. The bile duct was selectively 
cannulated
with a balloon catheter and .025 guidewires. The distal CBD has
an estimated diameter of 6mm-7mm. There is abrubt cut-off of the
proximal CBD consistent with bile duct injury. An occulsion
cholangiogram did not result in passage of contrast beyond the
cut-off. Attempts at bridging the cut-off with a quidewire were
not successful.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a recent hx of cholecystitis and cholangitis (___), 
managed medically due to concurrent NSTEMI w/trop >84 underwent 
an interval laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy on 
___, which was complicated by an iatrogenic CBD transection and 
cardiac enzyme elevation. The patient was transfered to ___ 
for further cardiac evaluation and management of his bile duct 
injury. Cardiology assessment recommended an alternative Toprol 
dose but otherwise recommended no further cardiac opitimization 
for surgery. The patient underwent a A PTC drain had been placed 
on ___ after occlusion was noted on ERCP at an OSH. 

The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit 
for monitoring on ___. There the patient was started on 
Vanc/Pip-Tazo, omeprazole for GI prophylaxis, Dilaudid PCA for 
pain control and was made NPO. Cardiac enzymes were cycled which 
revealed no rising troponin levels. On ___ the Pip-Tazo were 
d/c'ed and Ampicilin Sulbactam was started. The patient was then 
transferred to the floor. 

On ___ the patient was started on PO lopressor and dilaudid 
with IV versions of both being disconitnued. The patient's PTBD 
drain was found to be out by the nurse in the afternoon for 
which an interventional radiology team was called for the PTBD 
drain to be replaced. After the replacement of the drain the 
patient returned to the floor in stable condition. At this time 
the patient was continued on the Vanc and the Amp-Sulbactam. 

On ___ the patient underwent preoperative evaluation. 

On ___, the patient underwent a hepaticojejunostomy 
successfully. The patient returned to the floor with an NGT, a 
PTBD, and a bulb drain to suction. After a brief, uneventful 
stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV 
fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and a dilaudid 
PCA for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received a dilaudid PCA with good effect and 
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. The patient was 
started on all home prostate medications prior to removal of 
foley. The folwy was removed and pateint voided prior to 
discharge. 

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. The patient's wound was 
monitored for possible signs of infection.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay. He was encouraged to 
get up and ambulate as early as possible.

On ___ a repeat tube cholangiogram was obtained which 
demonstrated patent anastamosis.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male patient that initially presented to the 
hospital on ___ with abdominal pain and nausea.  While in 
the ED on an ultrasound and a CT scan of the abdomen were done 
and he was found to have gallstone pancreatitis.  The following 
day he was admitted to the hospital and he underwent an ERCP 
with sphincterotomy and extraction of sludge.  Surgery was 
consulted on the ___ for a possible cholecystectomy.  On 
___ he underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy after he is 
LFTs and T bili were within normal limits.  Please see operative 
report for further details on the surgery.  After an 
uncomplicated procedure he was sent to the floor and and kept 
n.p.o. given his history of severe pancreatitis.  On postop day 
3 he was found to have continuous abdominal pain it was decided 
to do CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis which showed edema and 
possible fluid surrounding the pancreas.  Given the initial 
presentation of severe pancreatitis and that in mature 
collection seen on the CT scan, it was decided not to place a 
drain in the collection and manage conservatively with 
observation.  On postop day 4 he was started on a clear liquid 
diet.  After he was tolerating clear liquid diet he was advanced 
to a regular diet.  Today he is tolerating a regular diet, has 
vital signs within normal limits, has normal bowel function, and 
reports having no abdominal pain.  He is discharged in good 
condition.

Do not drink any alcohol.  (Very important)
Please continue nutrition with Carnation breakfast with every 
meal.

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o You may shower. You have small plastic bandages called 
steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are 
the thin paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if 
they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
In brief, Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a history 
of metastatic prostate cancer on mitoxantrone who initially 
presented with malaise, sore throat, and fevers. Prior to his 
admission on ___, he was seen in the ED ___ for these 
complaints and was discharged to home with a prescription for 
azithromycin. However, his symptoms failed to improve after 
treatment so he re-presented to the ED on ___. In the ED, he 
received cefepime, vanco, and fluconazole as he had recently 
been neutropenic and was admitted to OMED on ___. On 
admission, he was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime 
which was narrowed to cefepime alone when he was found to be 
not-neutropenic. There was no obvious source of infection with 
normal U/A and CXR. His regular dose of prednisone was held.  
.  
On the evening of ___, patient had a witnessed aspiration 
event with associated hypoxia. CXR confirmed new infiltrate at ___ 
lung base. He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonitis in 
the ICU. He was cotinued on cefepime alone. He was ruled out for 
flu with DFA and all cultures remained negative including urine 
legionella Ag. He received aggressive chest ___ and O2 was weaned 
to RA. He had a swallow evaluation which cleared him for a 
pureed diet which was started. He had SBP readings in the ___, 
although asymptomatic, and he received IVF with SBP to 100s. He 
received a total of 1.5 L NS during his MICU stay. Labs during 
his MICU stay revealed an increase in WBC count (4->7), 
significant bandemia of 42%, slight Hct drop (stable on repeat), 
and stable thrombocytopenia. A random cortisol was checked and 
was 29.  
.  
On transfer back to the floor the patient is breathing 
comfortably on room air. Notes he ate new diet without problem. 
He denies any current fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerns.  
.
# Aspiration: Patient was continued on cefpodoxime for 5 more 
days, he was seen by  speech and swallow and his diet was nectar 
thickened liquids.  
.  
# Prostate cancer: Patient's prednisone was held while concern 
for infection, then restarted on the day of discharge.  There 
was no chemo given during the hospitalization, patient was 
followed up as an outpatient
- Tx as per outpatient oncology team  
- restart prednisone tomorrow  
.
# Code: Full code (confirmed with pt)  
.  
# Dispo: social work was consulted prior to discharge for help 
with patient coping as he felt concerned about his functional 
decline.  Home services were set up for this patient.

IMAGING:
Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of ___  5:42:06 ___   
Narrow complex tachycadia appears to be probable atrial flutter 
with 
ventricular premature beats also seen. Diffuse non-specific ST-T 
wave changes. Cannot exclude prior anterior and inferior 
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of 
___ the rhythm is now atrial flutter. Rate has increased. 
Prior inferior wall myocardial infarction seen on the other 
tracing is less clearly apparent on this due to baseline 
artifact and the flutter waves.  

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
FINDINGS: 
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate 
enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Aortic knob 
calcifications are re- demonstrated.  There is mild pulmonary 
vascular engorgement, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy 
retrocardiac and right basilar opacity could reflect 
atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
IMPRESSION: 
Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette with mild pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion but no overt edema.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis. 

Cardiovascular Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of ___    
COMMENTS:      
1.  Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left 
heart 
filling pressures with a depressed cardiac index.  The 
intracardiac 
pressures were as follows in mmHg:  RA mean 16, RV 40/17, PA 
___ (mean 
30), PCW mean 22.  The heart rate was 100 BPM.  The PA sat was 
56% with 
an arterial sat of 98%.  The cardiac output/index was calculated 
using 
the ___ equation with an assumed oxygen consuption.  The 
Cardiac output 
was calculated at 2.96 l/min, the cardiac index was 1.35 
l/min/m2. 
2. Successful Placement of 40cc IABP via right femoral artery 
and 
sutured in place. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Elevated right and left heart filling pressures 
2. Depressed cardiac output/index. 

Portable TEE (Complete) Done ___ at 1:51:01 ___      FINAL 
Conclusions  
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or 
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial 
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. Left atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 
cm/s). The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is severely depressed (LVEF<30 %). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic 
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are 
complex (>4mm), non-mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is 
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension (likely underestimated). There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No SEC or thrombus in the ___. Severely 
depressed left ventricular systolic function. Depressed right 
ventricular systolic function. Moderate to severe mitral and 
tricuspid regurgitation. Complex atheroma of the aortic arch and 
descending aorta.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 4:06 
___  
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued 
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable 
pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild retrocardiac opacification 
is consistent with atelectasis and possible small pleural 
effusion. 

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done ___ at 1:41:43 ___      
FINAL 
Conclusions  
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 10% 
to 15%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed 
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the 
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly 
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could 
not be determined. 

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate left ventricular dilation with 
severe global hypokinesis. The septum is near-akinetic. Dilated 
and hypokinetic right ventricle. Unable to assess pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure.

initially not treated given lack of infectious symptoms. 
Developed cough after extubation, spiked fevers on ___ and 
developed a leukocytosis on ___. He was started on levofloxacin 
for presumed CAP. Strep and MRSA on sputum culture. Patient 
should complete planned 10 day course of levofloxacin 750mg QD 
through ___ and doxycycline 100mg BID ___. Symptoms improving 
prior to discharge.
  
# Diarrhea: large volume liquid stools reported, C.diff 
negative. No leukocytosis, fevers, cramping, reported bleeding 
or melena. Has RUQ tenderness with cholelithiasis without 
evidence of cholecystitis, LFTs and lipase WNL. Denies IVDU 
history. HIV negative. RUQ U/S without evidence of cirrhosis, 
focal lesions, cholecystitis. Symptoms improved with trial of 
Creon. 
 
# Depression / Hx suicide attempt: Patient has outpatient 
Psychiatrist and treated at ___, reports long term use of

Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with history of oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal 
cancer s/p cycle 2 of cisplatin on ___, with concurrent 
radiation therapy, presents with fever, vomiting, weight loss, 
worsening leukopenia. The patient was recently discharged from a 
hospitalization for nausea and vomiting felt to be secondary to 
treatment related gastroparesis that improved with addition of 
metoclopromide. He has treatment related odynophagia that is 
managed with percocet per g tube.
.
# Fever and neutropenia: The patient was not yet neutropenic on 
admission and antibiotics were initially held. Admission CXR, 
KUB, and cultures were all negative for an infectious source. 
The patient remained febrile however, became absolutely 
neutropenic, and was started on Cefepime. On ___, the patient 
continued to have fevers and became mildly hypotensive with SBP 
in the low 90's, but appeared well. Repeat CXR and blood 
cultures were obtained and a fluid bolus was given. Vancomycin 
was added at this time based on his treatment-related 
mucositis.Pt remained with febile neutropni fo rmore than 3 days 
adn flagyl was added for anaerob coverage in teh setting of 
mucositis. Fluconazole was increased to a dose of 400 mg 
___  defervesed on ___ and neutropenia resolved on 
___. Antibiotics were discontinued 24 hrs after resolution 
of neutropenia and fever and pt remained afebrile.All blood 
cutures and urine cutures were negative.
# Vomiting: The patient had been taking Ensure plus as a bolus 
per G tube as an outpatient, but vomited a portion the day of 
admission. Admission KUB was negative for obstruction and he was 
treated with antiemetics and continued on metoclopromide for 
gastroparesis. After discussion with the nutrition service, he 
was restarted on ___ dilution, low volume, continuous tube feeds 
with the aim of increasing his hourly volume as tolerated. 
Although he clearly tolerated the dilute continuous feeds better 
than the bolus, tube feeds were intermittantly held when he felt 
nauseated and obstructed. Prioir to discharge bolus feedings 
were resumed an dpt tolerated them well.
# Oropharyngeal cancer with treatment related 
odynophagia/mucositis: The patient was in the midst of getting 
concurrent cisplatin with radiation. He continued his radiation 
as scheduled during his admission. The patient had been managing 
his pain with a fentenyl patch and percocet. Fentanyl patch dose 
was increased to 75 mcg/hr and for breakthrough pain patinet was 
started on dialudid IV , although he required at most 2 doses 
/24 hrs. Pt was also started on the oncologic mix prn and 
fluconazole for the mucositis/thrush.Pt completed his radiation 
treatment during his hospital stay . He did not get his last 
dose of cisplatin as he was still neutropenic at the time.
#Superficial Venous thrombi: Pt had a left picc line place 
becauase of poor peripheral venous access. Pt developed redness 
and swelling o fleft arm and left upper extremity u/s showed a 
clot in the basilic and cephalic veins. The picc line was 
removed and pt was started on therapeutic lovenox.During 
hospital saty erythema and swelling improved significantly. Pt 
to complete a 2 week course of lovenox.

Imaging:
Liver U/S ___: 
FINDINGS:  There is a tiny hyperdense focus in the liver which 
likely represents calcified granuloma.  Otherwise, the liver 
shows no evidence of focal lesions or textural abnormality.  
Doppler assessment of the main portal vein shows patency and 
hepatopetal flow.  There is no ascites.  There is no evidence of 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The CBD 
measures 6 mm.  The gallbladder is normal without evidence of 
stones or gallbladder wall thickening.  The tail of the pancreas 
is not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas, but the 
visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable.  The 
spleen measures 8.0 cm and has a homogeneous echotexture.  
Limited views of the right kidney and IVC are unremarkable.  

MRCP ___
FINDINGS:  There are multiple small nonenhancing T2 
hyperintensities throughout the liver, likely biliary hamartomas 
and/or simple cysts. There are few subcentimeter ares within the 
liver which are hyperenhancing on arterial phase but do not 
persist in other sequences (15:22, 27). There is small amount of 
perihepatic free fluid and tiny amount of free fluid is seen in 
the right paracolic gutter. The gallbladder is unremarkable.  
There is no evidence of cholelithiasis.  There is no intra- or 
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  There is no 
choledocholithiasis.  The pancreas is of normal signal 
intensity.  The pancreatic duct is not dilated. There is no 
surrounding fat stranding or fluid collections to suggest acute 
inflammation.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The spleen 
is within normal limits.   There are tiny nonenhancing T2 
hyperintense foci in the left kidney, likely simple renal cysts. 
The kidneys otherwise enhance symmetrically without 
hydronephrosis or masses.  
The visualized stomach, small and large bowel are grossly 
unremarkable. The intraabdominal aorta and its branches are 
patent.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
There are no concerning osseous lesions.  
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pancreatitis on MRI.  Small amount of 
perihepatic free fluid and tiny amount of fluid in the right 
paracolic gutter.
2.  No cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# pancreatitis, acute
Ms ___ is a ___ yo woman with history of osteoporosis, past 
medication related transaminase elevation, and NSAID gastritis, 
who presented with 1 day duration of acute epigastric pain 
accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea.  She was found to have 
Lipase elevation to 2462 in the ED, consistent with 
pancreatitis. She was admitted for bowel rest and IV fluids, and 
her pain, nausea and diarrhea all self-resolved without any 
medications or interventions. She was afebrile, denied any 
alcohol use, and her liver enzymes, CBC, chemistries, 
triglycerides and calcium were all WNL. She was seen by 
gastroenterology, who recommended RUQ U/S and MRCP. Imaging were 
negative for stones or pancreatic abnormalities, and only 
remarkable for incidental findings of small liver cysts vs 
biliary hamartomas.  Her diet was advanced, and she tolerated 
this well by discharge. Her transient symptoms were likely due 
to gall stone passage. She did endorse taking a weight loss 
nutritional supplement Garcinia, which may have actions on the 
pancreas. Uncertain if this may have contributed to her 
symptoms, so she is counseled to discontinue this supplement. 
She is also counseled to avoid alcohol and fatty foods, and 
follow up with GI clinic.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ woman with a
history of Crohn's disease in the past as well as an esophageal
stricture who had a recent endoscopy for increasing upper
gastrointestinal symptoms.  This showed a mass in the stomach. 
Biopsies were done which showed the suspicion of intramucosal
carcinoma.  An endoscopic ultrasound was performed which showed 
a
3 cm mass.  This seem to involve only the mucosa however when
Endo mucosal resection was considered, the lesion was not able 
to
be lifted with a saline injection thus raising the suspicion for
deeper disease or scarring from multiple biopsies which had
previously been taken.  Regardless, the Endo mucosal resection
could not be completed.  She has had CT scan which shows no
evidence of metastatic disease and it is unclear from the scan
exactly where the lesion is though it is described as being in
the distal body of the stomach. Patient was evaluated by Dr.

CXR (___)
Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged.  Vague opacity at the 
right lung 
apex projecting over the anterior first rib could be 
superimposition of normal structures or a new but subtle lung 
lesion.  If the clinical situation does not clarify, chest CT 
would be reasonable. Heart is top-normal size.  There is no 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

___ 1:16 pm BLOOD CULTURE
   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with PMHx of severe iron deficiency anemia, 
oligometastatic colon cancer s/p colectomy and partial liver 
resection (now in remission), prior small intestinal bleeds, 
HTN/HLD, and PE on apixaban admitted for persistent dyspnea most 
likely multi-factorial in nature, with major component due to 
severe iron deficiency anemia and mild hypervolemia. Received 2U 
pRBC and IV iron infusion as well as IV Lasix x1. Symptoms 
improved with reassuring oxygenation and so discharged home with 
plan for PCP follow up.

# DYSPNEA
Presented for persistent exertional dyspnea that has been 
ongoing problem for weeks-months. Likely multifactorial 
including subacutely worse anemia, underlying moderate pulmonary 
hypertension with mild hypervolemia, emphysema, as well as 
anxiety. Mildly volume overload on exam though without evidence 
of acute decompensated heart failure, proBNP negative. EKG and 
troponins reassuring. Overall low concern for recurrent 
pulmonary embolism as dyspnea is more sub-acute / chronic in 
nature and was without significant hypoxia at rest or with 
exertion. Received 2U pRBC and IV iron infusion. Further 
received 40 IV Lasix x1 for mild volume overload. Symptoms 
overall improved and so discharged home with plan for increased 
maintenance Lasix dose until PCP follow ___ require ongoing 
treatment for persistent anemia in setting of iron deficiency 
and likely chronic slow GI bleeding.

# ANEMIA
# Hx GI BLEEDING
Likely component of slow GI losses given history of small bowel 
angioectasias and iron deficiency anemia refractory to home iron 
supplementation. No evidence of acute or emergent GI bleed- no 
hemoptysis, melena, BRBPR. Also with possible contribution from 
reported history of beta thalassemia though unclear to what 
extent this is responsible for symptoms. Of note is systemically 
anti-coagulated for prior PE though no evidence of significant 
acute blood loss. s/p 2U pRBC during admission as well as IV 
iron infusion. Continued home oral iron supplement at discharge.

# HYPONATREMIA
Likely hypervolemic related to held Lasix doses. Received 40 IV 
Lasix x1. Discharged on 40 mg Po Lasix daily. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
=================================

# COLON CANCER, STAGE I
Complicated by previous oligometastases. No evidence of disease 
recurrence; his next surveillance colonoscopy is due in ___.

# DEPRESSION
- Sertraline 100 mg PO/NG DAILY

# CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE DEPOSITION DISEASE

- Discharge Cr: 0.8

[ ] Please repeat CBC and Chem-10 to ensure anemia is stable and 
hyponatremia are stable to improved. 

[ ] Increased Lasix to 40 mg PO daily until time of PCP follow 
up. ___ re-assess weight / volume status and titrate 
accordingly. 

[ ] Recommend setting up outpatient iron transfusions and repeat 
follow up with Dr. ___ further management and work up of 
patients anemia. Oral iron supplementation seems to have failed, 
although could trial dosage increase of PO iron. If anemia 
continues to be refractory, persistently may also benefit from 
GI referral to re-assess prior angioectasias / possible repeat 
push enteroscopy. 

[ ] Recommend ongoing IV iron infusions given that ferritin 
remains low despite oral supplementation.

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
sent to the ___ ED due to severe catatonia with hemodynamic 
instability that had continued despite 2 weeks of treatment at 
___ 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ECT treatment, bilateral. You received 11 acute phase 
treatments, and your first continuation treatment. 

 
History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of
Depression, psychosis, and polysubstance dependence (ecstsy, 
THC, Alcohol), with one prior psychiatric hospitalization in 
___ for significant psychotic and suicidal symptoms that lead 
the shutdown of his school for a day and
expulsion, who was transferred to ___ ED from ___ 
___ ED where he first presented on ___ with 
catatonic symptoms that lead to
hemodynamic instability and had been reported to be unresponsive
to medication managment (ativan and zyprexa) by ___ 
___. He was transferred to our hospital specifically 
because of the availability of ECT.
Upon admission to Deac 4 on ___ he was awake, alert, taking
in PO, and slowly responsive to questions, however quickly
decompensated to a catatonic state that same evening that
escalated to the point where there was concern about his ability
to protect his airway (had shallow breathing, unable to manage
his secretions). He has been cared for on the ___ service
from ___ - ___ when he was transferred back
to ___ 4 for further care. There has been no clear medical 
cause other than his psychiatric and substance abuse history for 
his catatonic symptoms and no further work up was felt to be 
necessary by the medical team after again reviewing past work up 
from ___. Based on history from his parents, the 
most likely diagnosis has remained schizophrenia comorbid with 
ecstasy abuse.  

While on the ___ service, he received variable doses of
ativan, at times he would refuse to take his ativan and it would
be administered as an injection. 

On the day of readmission, Mr. ___ presents much the same way 
as he did on
his one day admission to ___ 4 prior to his transfer to 
___. He is unable to recount a clear history of the events 
leading to his hospitalization. At first states he has been here 
3 days. With prompting he is able to recall being in the 
hospital longer and in fact being at ___ for 
several weeks. He is unable to volunteer spontaneous history. 
With prompting in questions, he confirms concern about
cameras watching his house at home, suicidal thinking, and fears
for his health and weight loss. He is able to see that he has
""less motion"" ""is not speaking"" ""less ability to do daily 
tasks.""
However, he feels that he would be fine to leave the hospital at
this time. He also does not feel he needs medications. 
""Sometimes I forget certain things..what is going on in my 
environment"" ""I would be fine without medications. I could just 
go home and everything would work out."" ""I can do the same thing 
at home."" He demonstrated significant attention and memory 
difficulty as a function of the severity of his symptoms. He was 
unable to keep track of what was told to him by his treatment 
team. His insight and judgement was severly impaired.  He is 
aware that guardianship has been applied for to have his parents 
appointed an alternate decision maker. He does not oppose this.

Brief Hospital Course:
# LEGAL: ___
# PSYCHIATRIC:   Upon return to the inpatient psychiatry service 
on ___, collateral from the parents and ___ team 
revealed that patient would show some improvement with ativan if 
he consistently received it.  However, when he would refuse 
ativan he did he became more catatonic. Patient was started on 
scheduled ativan, which he could not refuse due to possibility 
of irreversible harm given his persistent catatonic state. It 
was administered IM for his safety, despite the lack of court 
commitment or guardianship at that time. His parents were in 
agreement with this plan as they observed over and over how 
necessary ativan was for ___ to remain conscious 
consistently. Ultimately guardianship was obtained by his 
parents and the patient was committed on a section 7,8,8b.  His 
maximum dosing of ativan during admission was 2 mg q 4 hour. As 
Mr. ___ continued to remain catatonic despite ativan dosing 
and continued to struggle in consistently eating his meals, 
consistently drinking fluids, was unable to consistently accept 
pills of ativan (struggled with pill compliance outside of a 
hospital as well), was unable to participate in sustained 
conversations or in structured groups and remained in such 
danger of ongoing decompensation from his illness, permission to 
begin ECT was sought from the court on a section 7,8,8b.  The 
role of ECT in severe catatonia was discussed with the patient 
and his family and was assessed to be his best chance at 
stabilizing and being able to return home with his parents 
safely back to ___. Dr. ___, and 
anesthesia were all consulted, in addition to Dr. ___ 
unit director. With ECT treatment, under the care of Dr. 
___, Mr. ___ did indeed show significant improvement 
in his symptoms. He was able to tend to his hygiene, eat his 
meals regularly, speak spontaneously with the team, socialize in 
the milieu, attend groups, and participate in enjoyable 
activities. As his catatonia improved with ECT, he was found to 
be more sedated with some signs of ativan intoxication and the 
dose of ativan was ultimately reduced to 2mg TID. 

While on the ___ service, abilify had been started to work 
to target his psychotic symptoms. He had a prior good response 
to abilify when psychiatrically hospitalized in ___. With 
abilify, ativan, and the completion of ECT #11 the patient 
appeared to have reached maximum benefit from ECT. Where no 
further improvement was seen and his parents had felt that he 
returned very much to his baseline. In general, he had tolerated 
ECT well with few side effects, but towards the end of the 
course did present as having more short term confusion, 
sedation, and forgetfullness around the ECT treatments. Despite 
dramatic improvement with ECT, ___ did remain slowed in 
response latency, demonstrated reduced expression of thought 
content, psychomotor slowing, and a generalized negativism. This 
always appeared less when he was engaged in enjoyable activity 
on the unit or visiting with his family.  A trial of a lower 
dose of ativan to 1mg TID was attempted to rule out sedation as 
being a cause, but this appeared to increase the slowing, so 
this was increased back to ativan 2mg TID (higher doses had 
appeared sedating). In efforts to treat residual psychosis, 
abilify was increased to 30mg daily, but this also did not 
appear to make a significant impact.  Ultimately abilfy 20mg po 
daily was continued and appeared to be the best dose to target 
some residual mild auditory hallucinations without increasing 
slowing. However, he did have some increased tone in his upper 
extremities that was not present on the lower dose of abilify. 
This should continue to be monitored through time and a lower 
dose of abilify could again be considered.  

At time of discharge, Mr. ___ was free of symptoms of 
depression. He was able to reflect back to a time when he had 
been feeling depressed with suicidal thoughts in the time period 
before his hospitalization at ___. He had reflected on a 
past feeling that he was very sick, had cancer, and was going to 
die, so he had thoughts at ending his own life. At time of 
discharge there was no evidence of suicidal thoughts, he 
appeared future oriented, and appeared motivated to continue to 
work towards goals of trying to work again or return to school. 
He felt healthy, back to himself, and no longer feared cancer of 
physical ailments. Through out his admission, his connection to 
and love for his family was apparent and appeared to be his most 
significant protective factor. At time of discharge, ___ 
denied auditory and visual hallucinations. He could reflect back 
to past symptoms of prominent voices, outside of his head that 
he experienced as commentary of his thoughts and actions. These 
voices were mixed with sound and at worst happened frequently 
through the day. Prior to discharge they lasted seconds 
infrequently, and this appeared to resolve with abilfy 20mg 
daily, but will continue to need to be monitored closely 
ultimately for effectiveness and ongoing tolerability. This has 
been his only antipsychotic trial thus far. 

At his worst, he had prominent visual hallucinations, for 
example seeing a fly which came and went during his catatonia 
based upon what he was saying and what the voices were saying. 
When he presented to the inpatient unit initally he was 
significantly internally preoccupied. Sitting or standing 
staring at the wall or ceiling for prolonged periods of time. 
This had resolved by time of discharge, but at times still 
appeared distracted for brief periods of time.

Mr. ___ remains at risk of relapse into psychotic and 
catatonic symptoms through time. At this time, he appears safe 
and appropriate to transition home with his family back to ___ with ongoing close follow up. His risk to himself has 
been reduced by a number of modalities: 1. The significant 
improvement of his symptoms and the resolution of his severe 
catatonia leading to medical instability with ECT treatment with 
the plan of a taper of ECT through time. 2. By continuing on 
oral ativan as evidence favors ongoing ativan use vs slow taper 
through time, 3. Antipsychotic use to treat his psychotic 
disorder 4. His parents being appointed ___ Guardians for 
appropriate decision making as ___ continues to have 
impaired insight and judgement overall and was not able to 
follow through on his treatment prior to this hospitalization in 
the past. Legal department states this guardianship would be 
recognized in ___. 5. The ongoing close monitoring of 
his health and behavior by his parents who are very thoughtful 
about his care and very dedicated to his ongoing health. 6. 
___ current commitment to sobriety and the amount of 
education provided regarding the dangers of drugs and alcohol. 
7. The reconnection to mental health follow up in ___. 

Although, it would be most ideal for ___ to transition 
directly to a partial hospital program or day program, this is 
not possible given his current lack of Medicaid. His parents are 
able and trustworthy to take him to emergency care should he 
show signs of relapse in a less structured environment. 

Diagnosis: While at ___ he had a medical 
evaluation that included the following:  MRI, EEG, LP, ___, 
RPR, LFTs, and ammonia level - all of this was unremarkable. He 
had multiple physical exams by medical doctors at ___ and 
here at ___ that did not reveal an organic basis to his 
catatonia outside of mental illness and substance abuse. while 
at ___ NMDA-R ab was obtained and it was negative, Thyroid was 
normal, in addition to urine studies. History and presentation 
has consistently pointed to likely schizophrenia with comorbid 
ecstasy abuse as the primary cause of his acute catatonia and 
psychosis. He was reported to have a normal developmental 
history by his pediatrician. Although he is reported to be at 
baseline by family, his presentation at discharge appears to be 
related to residual effects of ecstasy versus negative symptoms 
associated with psychotic disorder vs residual symptoms of 
catatonia that have not responded to ECT or ativan. ___ was 
drawn and is currently pending. This is expected to be negative. 
Final results will be forwarded to outpatient providers. It is 
also recommended that the patient have a complete neurologic 
exam by a pediatric neurologist and a complete slit lamp eye 
exam. Although his CERULOPLASMIN level was normal at 20. It will 
also be helpful to follow up with his pediatrician who has known 
him through his whole life to judge if he has returned to his 
known baseline.

# MEDICAL:
Hemodynamincs/Volume status:  Patient had a known history of 
hemodynamic instability, which was responsive to IV hydration, 
and laboratory abnormalities (rise in Cr and AST) when catatonic 
and unable to keep up with his nutritional and volume needs. 
Given concern for prior hemodynamic instability, patient's 
orthostatics were monitored.  Although patient was initially 
able to eat, once his catatonia became more incapacitating he 
was started on IVFs.  At times, he had sinus tachycardia and 
repolarization abnormalities.  Cardiology consulted and cleared 
him for continued ECT without need for additional workup. At 
time of discharge his blood pressure and pulse remained normal 
for several weeks as his hydration status significantly 
improved. 

Urinary retention:  Patient was less interactive and bladder 
scans were initiated, which revealed urinary retention.  A foley 
 was placed and greater than 900 cc of urine was drained from 
patient's bladder.  Urine was noted to be concentrated and there 
was concern for sediment causing difficulty with drainage.  
Resolution of urinary symptoms upon return to inpatient 
psychiatry and there was no reoccurrence of difficulty once his 
catatonia resolved. 

Ophthomology: Patient denied visual problems through out his 
admission. Through out his time in the hospital he was found to 
have symmetrical mydriasis without clear etiology. This was 
present upon admission and remained essentially unchanged. He 
was also noted to have a reduced blink frequency and was 
observed to have times when he would sleep with his eyes open 
(when not catatonic ). Optho was consulted and they recommended 
outpatient evaluation  and lacrilube application to eyes for dry 
eyes and decreased blink
frequency. He should seek more urgent help should his eyes 
become red and/or irritated. 

# MILIEU:  No behavioral problems in the milieu.  As he became 
less catatonic, he was able to interact with other patients and 
initiate conversation. He participated in groups and was social 
with peers. 

# FAMILY/SOCIAL WORK: Team was consistently in contact with 
patient's family through out admission and worked to have his 
father and mother appointed guardians. Several family meetings 
were held. His parents were very dedicated to his care and came 
to visit him every day during his admission. They should 
continue to be closely involved in all medical decision making 
outside of the hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

As you know, you came to ___ for catatonia.  Your catatonia 
was so paralyzing, you were not able to care for yourself or 
make your own decisions.  We had to get the court and your 
parents involved to help make decisions for you.  They helped us 
to provide and you to obtain  the treatment you needed (ECT and 
ativan) to start interacting with your surroundings. 

As we have discussed, there are many reasons for catatonia, but 
psychosis and substance abuse are both common causes.  To treat 
your psychosis, you are on ability. To help prevent relapse and 
treat residual symptoms of catatonia you remain on ativan. ECT 
was a necessary treatment given the degree of your symptoms and 
it is currently being tapered. It is going to be very important 
for you to avoid substances in the future as they trigger 
recurrence of psychosis and catatonia.

Please follow up with all outpatient appointments as listed - 
take this discharge paperwork to your appointments.

Please continue all medications as directed.

Please avoid abusing alcohol and any drugs--whether prescription 
drugs or illegal drugs--as this can further worsen your medical 
and psychiatric illnesses.

Please contact your outpatient psychiatrist or other providers 
if you have any concerns.

Please call ___ or go to your nearest emergency room if you feel 
unsafe in any way and are unable to immediately reach your 
health care providers. Please go to your nearest emergency room 
if you again become catatonic.
 
We wish you the best of health,
Your ___ Mental Health Care Team

CXR (___):
""IMPRESSION:  
Bilateral patchy airspace opacities are suspicious for 
multifocal atypical 
infection. Pulmonary edema is also possible, but less favored

effusions.""

CT CHEST (___):
""IMPRESSION: 
1. Diffuse irregularity of the bronchial tree with traction 
bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe.  Diffuse reticulation 
throughout the lungs. Findings could reflect fibrotic NSIP or 
chronic sequelae of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  No prior 
chest CTs available for comparison. Patient appears to be status 
post right upper lobe and lower lobe VATS wedge resections. 
Therefore correlation with findings on pathology is recommended. 

2. Patchy peribronchial consolidative opacities in the bilateral 
upper lobes could represent superimposed pneumonia.  Clinical 
correlation is recommended. 
3.  Trace pneumomediastinum is likely related to patient's 
interstitial lung disease. 
4. Mild mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.""

PROCEDURES/PATHOLOGY:
==============================
NONE 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of bipolar 
disorder and hypersensitivity pneumonitis who presented with 
acute dyspnea and cough in the setting of progressively 
worsening dyspnea over the last ___s concern for 
medication non-compliance for his bipolar disease. He reported 
that he was exposed to a brush fire approximately 3mo prior with 
progressive worsening SOB with exertion and eventually at rest 
since that event, but on the day prior to admission, that SOB 
increased significantly and he developed a cough productive of 
sputum. Based upon CXR and leukocytosis, there was concern for 
CAP that was treated with doxycycline (no QT prolongation). CT 
demonstrated concern for diffuse irregularity of the bronchial 
tree and potential superimposed pneumonia c/w known 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which has been followed at ___. 
The patient's SOB and cough improved on doxycycline. Steroids 
were deferred in the setting of concern for potential manic 
episode. Psych was consulted and they started him on quetiapine 
300mg PO QHS. He was placed on ___ and will be discharged 
to inpatient psychiatry with plan for pulmonary ___ in 
1mo.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
[ ] Medications STARTED: doxycycline 100mg PO BID (5 doses 
remaining), benzonatate 100mg PO TID prn cough, quetiapine 
fumaratate 300mg PO QHS
[ ] Please contact medicine service if he has any worsening 
pulmonary symptoms (worsening dyspnea at rest or on exertion, 
hemoptysis, etc.) or concern for worsening infection (new fever, 
hypoxemia, etc.)
[ ] Insurance: Patient needs insurance prior to making 
appointment with pulmonologist for 1mo. Social work was 
consulted on day of discharge, but they have NOT seen him yet
[ ] Pulmonary: CAP being treated with 5d course of doxycycline, 
but concern for potential worsening of hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis. Would likely benefit from PFTs and further 
evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. As above, steroids 
deferred for now
[ ] Psych: Continue management of bipolar
[ ] PCP: ___ thrombocytopenia with repeat CBC

#CAP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis:
Chest x-ray on the day of admission demonstrated patchy 
bilateral airspace opacities concerning for multifocal atypical 
pneumonia and he had an elevated WBC. He was started on 
doxycycline as it had lower risk of QT prolongation, and he 
would likely need antipsychotic medications. Ceftriaxone was not 
prescribed as this community acquired pneumonia could likely 
have been treated in the outpatient setting, but he required 
hospitalization for medication non-compliance for his BPD and 
was placed on a ___. CT chest was obtained as 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis history was unknown on admission, 
and it showed concern for ILD with superimposed pneumonia. In 
addition to a CAP, there is concern for flare of his 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis in the setting of brush fire 
exposure, but steroids were held in the setting of a potential 
manic episode and he has been saturating well at room air with 
improving dyspnea and cough. Pulmonology was consulted, but 
after they reviewed his outside record, they recommended 1mo 
___ with pulmonologist at ___ and agreed with plan for 
avoiding steroids. He will be discharged to psychiatry for 
management of his bipolar disorder. Per scheduling, he will need 
to obtain insurance prior to following up with outpatient 
pulmonary ___ in 1mo.

#BPD: Patient with known history of BPD and concern for 
medication non-compliance. Initially started on olanzapine 2.5mg 
BID, but transitioned to Seroquel 300mg PO QHS standing plus an 
additional 50mg PO Q8Hr prn anxiety/agitation. 

#Thrombocytopneia: Patient with thrombocytopenia that was stable 
between 135 to 114 on discharge. Urine legionella negative, LFTs 
normal. Recommend CBC ___ to continue to monitor.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with acute appendicitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your appendix removed 
laparoscopically.  You tolerated the procedure well and are now 
being discharged home with the following instructions:
Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
 
DANGER SIGNS:
Please call your surgeon if you develop:
- worsening abdominal pain
- sharp or severe pain that lasts several hours
- temperature of 101 degrees or higher
- severe diarrhea
- vomiting
- redness around the incision that is spreading
- increased swelling around the incision
- excessive bruising around the incision
- cloudy fluid coming from the wound
- bright red blood or foul smelling discharge coming from the 
wound
- an increase in drainage from the wound

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ on ___ because of alcohol 
intoxication and trauma to your left eye. While you were here, 
you underwent a safe detox, given that you drank a lot of 
alcohol per day. We also determined that you were Hepatitis B 
and C positive. These are both infections that are associated 
with liver cancer. As a result, we did an CT and MRI (imaging 
study) of your liver that showed lesions concerning for cancer. 
As a result, you are scheduled to follow up in clinic to manage 
your liver health. In the meantime, please continue to take all 
your medications as prescribed. It is especially important to 
take the lactulose 4 times a day, or until you have ___ bowel 
movements- this will prevent toxins from building up in your 
blood and causing mental confusion.

We also treated your left eye with steroids to help decrease the 
inflammation surrounding your trauma. We also continued your 
glaucoma eye drops for the left eye and treated both eyes with 
antibiotic eye drops because they ___ have been infected. After 
discharge, you have been given a prescription for protective 
glasses to shield your functional right eye. You have a follow 
up appointment at ___ Eye and Ear on ___.

In addition to the liver clinic appointment and the Mass Eye and 
Ear appointment on ___, you are also scheduled to see a primary 
care provider at ___'s ___ on ___. It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you make it to all of these appointments.

In addition to all these appointments, it is important that you 
do your best to stay sober and not drink alcohol. Drinking 
alcohol is extremely dangerous in a patient like you who has 
severe liver disease.

Thank you kindly for letting us take care of you.

Sincerely,
___ Medicine

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ with h/o prostate CA s/p resection and XRT, 
HTN and CKD on dialysis who presents with dysuria and reports of 
positive BCx from ___ clinic concerning for bacteremia.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Bacteremia
The ___ clinic reported the observation of gram 
negative rods during his dialysis, and was referred to our 
hospital for further evaluation.  Of note, patient reported 
subjective fever, chill and burning during urination, consistent 
with bacteremia.  However, there is no symptoms of SIRS while he 
was on the floor.  Patient was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin 
initially, which was switched on the ___ day of admission to 
cefepime.  The blood culture and sensitivity study from the 
initial positive specimen grew pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was 
sensitive to levofloxacin (this external lab did not run 
sensitivities to cipro).  Patient was discharged with oral 
ciprofloxacin for 14 days.  During this admission, blood culture 
was obtained daily, which all remained negative.  Patient 
remained afebrile, with stable vital signs, and no leukocytosis.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
-- Patient was asked to take Ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily for 14 
days

# Chronic kidney disease

requiring hemodialysis.  Patient was scheduled to receive 
hemodialysis on M, W, F.  His medication was hemodialysis dosed. 
 He received dialysis during this hospitalization without 
complications.

CHRONIC ISSUES
Patient has a long history of hypertension, and was treated 
medically.  We continued his outpatient medication regimen, 
which was held on days of dialysis.  His blood pressure was

DES to LAD ___ in-stent restenosis ___ on DAPT, DMII, CVA, 
SSS
s/p PPM ___, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, seizure, BPH who
presented to ___ with hematuria on ___.

Per discharge summary at ___, patient had Hgb drop from 11.8 to
10.3 but remained hemodynamically stable. CT A/P showed 1.5 x 
2.5
cm mass in left lateral urinary bladder, showing partial
obstruction of left ureter causing mild to moderate
hydronephrosis of left kidney. Right kidney also had mild
hydronephrosis. CBI was started and needed frequent manual
bladder irrigation for clots. Transferred to ___ due to need
for TURBT in setting of recent stent placement and risk of
bleeding as well as evaluation for palliative radiation.

ASA and Plavix were originally stopped on admission but 
restarted
by cardiology recommendations during his admission.

He reports that he is feeling okay. He noted leaking around his
foley catheter on transfer. Nurse flushed it and maybe saw one
small clot but the urine is flowing out clear and yellow. He
denies suprapubic tenderness. He denies dysuria. He denies
fevers/chills. He has some pressure in his left chest sometimes
but feels very anxious during these times and has a history of
anxiety so he thinks the pressure feeling is from that.

Has been having some cramping in his legs and soreness in his
back which he thinks is from lying in bed all day.

Brief Hospital Course:

CAD s/p repeat DES to LAD ___ in-stent restenosis ___ on 
DAPT,
DMII, CVA, SSS s/p PPM ___, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, seizure,
BPH who presented to ___ with hematuria on ___.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
#Hematuria
#New bladder mass: On dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT) for 
stent and
presented to ___ with hematuria and found to have bladder mass 
on
imaging which needs biopsy/resection. S/p CBI without any 
further
bleeding on the time of transfer.  Here, he was seen by both 
Urology and Cardiology.  Cardiology stated that ideally, he 
should be on DAPT for 12 months, but given the fact that surgery 
would be absolutely prohibitive, they stated that he could be 
paused with Plavix for 5 days prior to surgery, suggesting that 
this be done inside the hospital, and then have it restarted 
immediately post-op.  This would occurrr in about 6 weeks.  He 
would never stop his aspirin.  Since there was no immediate need 
for procedure, he had no interventions at this time.  Urine was 
ordered for cytology, but results were not back at time of 
discharge.  He also had resolved hematuria, so foley cath was 
successfully removed without complication. He was discharged 
home on alpha blocker (Doxazosin) as well as Flomax and will 
follow-up with Urology as an outpatient for surgical planning.  

#CAD s/p new stent ___: Not currently having active chest
pain, likely pressure symptoms over the past few days are 
anxiety
related as he has had trops neg x 3. He continued on aspirin, 
Plavix, isosorbide mononitrate, metoprolol and his home 
Simvastatin.

#Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine

#DMII: hold metformin, but restarted upon discharge.  

#Depression/Anxiety: continue sertraline, lamictal, clonazepam

I spent > 30 min in discharge planning and coordination of care.

You were admitted to the hospital with a mass in your bladder.  
You were seen by cardiology and urology who together decided 
that you should be on Plavix and Aspirin for at least 3 months 
after your last stent.  Then, we will coordinate surgery where 
you may need to come in to the hospital when Plavix is held for 
a few days prior to surgery.  Your bleeding from the foley 
stopped, and it was able to be removed.  If in the future you 
have any difficulty with being able to urinate or have any pain 
with blood clots in your urine, you should seek urgent medical 
attention at the nearest hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
After transport to ___ the Pt was seen by Thoracic surgery in 
the ED and was admitted to the SICU for further monitoring. ENT 
was consulted to evaluate his airway and upper aerodigestive 
tract. At the time of evaluation he complained of dysphagia but 
no difficulty breathing. He stated he had not had recent fevers 
and
had no neck pain. Endoscopic exam showed a 3x3cm posterior 
pharyngeal mass nearly occluding the airway, and the Pt was 
therefore taken to the operating room to safely secure his 
airway. He underwent awake fiberoptic intubation, direct 
laryngoscopy with biopsy, and drainage of the retropharyngeal 
cyst on ___. The cyst contained dark brown fluid consistent 
with hematoma. Please see the operative report for further 
details. The Pt was transferred to the PACU in stable condition 
and then returned to the SICU for further monitoring. He was 
subsequently extubated without difficulty, and reported that the 
dysphagia was gone. A follow-up CT of the neck showed resolution 
of the retropharngeal cyst. The Pt was eating and drinking 
normally and desired discharge. He had no complaints of 
dysphagia, respiratory distress, or any other concerns from a 
cardiac, pulmonary, GI, or GU standpoint. He was discharged home 
on augmentin 875mg bid x 10 days.   
  
Imaging:
CT Neck ___) - 24 x 31 x 18 mm subglottic cystic
mass, above the level of the cords, resulting in narrowing of 
the
airway. Possible etiologies include a mass, infection, or
postsurgical seroma/cyst (s/p anterior spinal fusion). No
neighboring lymphadenopathy seen. Direct visualization
recommended for further evaluation.

CT Neck ___ - The previously described cystic lesion in the 
hypopharynx has now 
resolved after incision and drainage; only a few locules of gas 
are seen 
within the evacuated pocket

TTE
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size,
and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 63 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

CXR 
In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable.  No evidence of appreciable vascular
congestion at this time.  No pneumonia or pleural effusion. 

VQ
IMPRESSION:  Normal lung scan.  Normal lung scan rules out 
recent
pulmonary embolism. 

Abdominal wall ultrasound
1. Tubular hypoechoic structure in the superficial tissues of 
the right lower quadrant may represent a thrombosed varicosity 
or in the setting new onset with heparinization, may represent a 
hematoma.
2. Moderate ascites is partially imaged.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of Graves (now 
hypothyroidism on synthroid), IgG Lambda Myeloma and Secondary 
Amyloidosis (s/p auto transplant ___, on Daratumumab), 
Depression, ESRD (on PD), Chronic Anemia (on epo), who presented
to ED from clinic with tachycardia, found to have new AFib and 
worsening anemia. Afib improved after blood transfusion and rate 
control with beta blocker. No obvious trigger other than anemia. 


#New Afib
Presented with new afib/RVR, which converted to sinus after 
blood transfusion and rate control with metoprolol. Patient 
underwent work-up for new afib, which was overall unrevealing. 
Anemia was a possible trigger. Her TSH and free T4 were wnl, 
although TSH toward lower end of normal and T4 toward upper end, 
suggesting she might tolerate a lower thyroid replacement dose 
and have less tendency toward afib. Trop elevation felt to 
result from mild demand in setting of ESRD, but not ACS. No PE 
on VQ scan, and TTE overall unrevealing. Her CHADS2VASC score 
was 2, and due to perceived increase in thrombotic risk due to 
amyloid, she was started on a heparin bridge to coumadin while 
on the ___ service, and transferred to ___ to complete this 
course. After being transferred to the ___ service the patient 
and her husband further questioned the decision to anticoagulate 
and the decision to bridge. In consultation with hem-onc, renal, 
and cardiology, this was felt to be a difficult risk-benefit 
assessment given her multiple factors potentially contributing 
to thrombotic risk and also to bleeding risk, including her 
amyloid and ESRD. Once multiple discussions occurred the patient 
opted to continue coumadin without further bridging, which was 
felt to be a medically reasonable choice. She was referred to 
the ___ clinic, who will contact her tomorrow to 
arrange further care. She was discharged on 5 mg daily, which 
seemed to be approximately the correct dosing based on her 
initial trajectory. She was also discharged on metoprolol 
succinate 12.5. 

#?Abdominal wall hematoma
The day of discharge the patient developed a nodular firm lesion 
on the lower right abdominal wall with ecchymosis. She noted 
that it was somewhat similar to lesions she has developed 
previously, although larger. On exam this seemed more firm and 
discrete than a typical  rectus sheath hematoma, so ultrasound 
was obtained. The appearance was most consistent with a 
thrombosed varicosity, although hematoma could not be ruled out. 
Because the patient wished to be discharged this could not be 
monitored for interval progression, although given the firm 
discrete nature, it seemed that if it was a hematoma it was 
likely contained and tamponaded. Gave instructions to patient to 
watch closely and have low threshold to seek further care should 
this worsen or additional lesions develop. Patient preferred to 
accept this risk rather than remain in the hospital. 

#Acute on chronic anemia
Patient with known anemia of renal failure/inflammation and 
already on Epo as an outpatient. Increased epo resistance is a 
possible cause. Also worsening myeloma potential cease. GI 
losses unlikely given negative guaiac x3. Normal bilirubin not
suggestive of destruction. She appropriately responded to 
transfusion. No evidence of iron deficiency or megaloblastic 
anemia. Has hem follow-up in 2 days and will have labs at that 
time.

#HTN
Mild-moderate persistent HTN despite amlodipine, which shoudl be 
addressed further as an outpatient. 

#Hypothyroidism (history of Graves)
Her TSH has been relatively suppressed on current regimen. 
Raised issue of potentially lowering dose with her PCP in case 
this make her less prone to afib. 

#IgG Lambda Myeloma and Secondary Amyloidosis (s/p auto 
transplant ___, on Daratumumab)
- held Daratumumab per ___ team

#ESRD (on PD)
#Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
Continued on PD, with renal consult, while inpatient. 

#Circumstances of discharge:
The patient was frustrated with being in the hospital for what 
seemed to be uncertain benefit of bridging to coumadin. This was 
compounded by poor sleep, noisy roommate, and being on ___ 
campus, where getting her peritoneal dialysis was tedious. While 
continuing bridging and monitoring her possible hematoma were 
recommended, these were not felt to be clear contraindications 
to discharge, and given her and her husband's understanding of 
the issues/risks and close follow-up, it was not felt that the 
discharge needed to occur against medical advice. 

=======================

Transitional issues:
- monitoring anemia, transfusing as needed, further diagnostics 
as appropriate
- consider need for metoprolol as rate control agent. can 
consider discontinuation if no further afib
- establishment with ___ clinic at ___ this week
- can consider whether or not to consider coumadin. will depend 
on patient preference, development of any bleeding 
complications, and potentially on further evidence of afib 
should she undergo outpatient cardiac monitoring
- assess abdominal wall lesion (?hematoma vs thrombosed 
varicosity)
- consider slight reduction in thyroid replacement as this may 
lessen risk of afib

Discharge Diagnosis:
Atrial fibrillation
Anemia
Abdominal wall clot or hematoma

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to anemia and a fast heart 
rate due to atrial fibrillation. We did not identify a clear 
reversible cause of the atrial fibrillation, although your 
anemia likely was a factor. You were started on Coumadin, a 
blood thinner used to reduce the risk of strokes in patients 
with atrial fibrillation. You also developed an area on your 
abdominal wall of unclear nature, but potentially a small blood 
clot or a collection of blood. While on Coumadin you are at 
increased risk of dangerous bleeding, so if you have any 
significant injuries (e.g. hitting your head) or notice new 
bleeding (e.g. red or black stool) you need to seek care right 
away. 

Plans after discharge:
- you should have labs checked in 2 days when you come back to 
___, including blood counts and your INR
- you should return to care if there is any enlargement of the 
bump on your abdomen or other bumps, or if you are having other 
new symptoms
- you can take Coumadin 5 mg daily for now. you should be 
contacted by the ___ clinic tomorrow to schedule follow-up 
in their clinic
- continue discussing with your outpatient providers whether or 
not to continue Coumadin
- continue addressing your anemia and high blood pressure with 
your outpatient providers

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old woman who had a fall and developed right 
SHOULDER DISLOCATION which was reduced by the ED physician and 
placement was confirmed with several shoulder X-Rays. She was 
treated with standing Tylenol, prn oxycodone 2.5 mg, and ___. She 
had a sling placement. The sling should remain in place for 
several weeks as she most likely had rotator cuff tear 
associated with her dislocation (case and images were discussed 
with orthopaedics). ___ cuff tear is a very common 
complication of shoulder dislocation in the elderly (per 
orthopaedic). She should see outpatient shoulder specialist in 
few weeks after discharge and appointment could not be scheduled 
because of discharge to rehab. She was admitted because of 
HYPOXIA in the ED. She had no H/O COPD, asthma, or significant 
smoking history. She had a history of angina but no heart 
failure (no cath but on medical treatment with Imdur). She had 
DOE for several weeks without explanation or diagnosis. She had 
a history of OSA treated with CPAP. Her CXR was normal except 
for hyperinflation. There was no pneumonia. Her most recent 
Echocardiogram (___) showed diastolic dysfunction. She 
underwent CTA of the chest, repeat Echocardiogram, and BNP. The 
CT showed no pulmonary embolism or significant interstitial 
pulmonary disease. However it showed bronchiectasis and evidence 
of prior lung infection. The ECHO and BNP were both suggestive 
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from long standing hypertension 
chronic diastolic heart failure. The Echo also suggested 
moderate aortic regurgitation. The hypoxia was also related to 
atelectasis from sedation required to reduce shoulder. She 
stated she was ""passed out"" from the morphine in the ER. She was 
treated with incentive spirometry, ambulation tid, and we 
finally added Lasix (instead of HCTZ). We also increased her BP 
medications (the atenolol and the Imdur for better BP control). 
We were able to wean O2. There was a question of URINARY TRACT 
INFECTION. Her UA was only positive for ___ WBC, nitrate, and 
few bacteria. She had no urinary symptoms initially but then 
developed urgency and was treated empirically with Bactrim. She 
was discharged to short term rehab (less than 30 days) for her 
inability to care for herself with shoulder pain and limited ROM 
and ankle sprain as she lives alone. 

The new diagnosis are :

Diastolic heart failure from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from 
chronic hypertension. 
Aortic regurgitation 
Bronchiectasis

She was asked to follow up with Cardiology and orthopaedic.  All 
of the above was discussed with her 2 daughters. ___ time 
more than 30 minutes.

Discharge Diagnosis:
dislocated right shoulder from a fall 
diastolic heart failure
aortic valve regurgitation
ankle sprain
hypoxemia
atelectasis
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).
 
Discharge Instructions:
You had dislocated right shoulder from a fall and an ankle 
sprain. The shoulder was reduced back to its place and that was 
confirmed with several shoulder X-Rays. Please use a sling for 
several weeks and avoid any shoulder movements. Please see your 
PCP regarding when to remove the sling and start shoulder 
movement or physical therapy. You had a low oxygen level in you 
blood which has improved. However, you had several tests 
including a CT of the chest, Echocardiogram, and BNP level. You 
were diagnosed with diastolic heart failure from hypertrophic 
cariomyopathy from chronic hypertension. Your BP was elevated 
during this hospitalization and your BP medications were 
adjusted. We also added Lasix instead of HCTZ for the heart 
failure. Please follow up with Cardiology and orghtopaedic.

___ ___ percutaneous nephrostomy tube report:
ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering 
divided doses of fentanyl (100 mcg) and Versed (2 mg) throughout 
the total intraservice time of 35 minutes, during which the 
patient's hemodynamic parameters were 
continuously monitored.   
PROCEDURE: Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. 
FINDINGS: After the risks and benefits of the procedure were 
explained to the patient, written informed consent was obtained. 
The patient was placed prone on the table and her bilateral 
flanks were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. A 
pre-procedure timeout was performed. 
LEFT: Under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, a left lower 
pole posterior calix was cannulated with a 21-gauge Cook needle 
through which a 0.018 wire was advanced into the renal pelvis. 
The needle was exchanged for AccuStick sheath. The wire was 
removed. Clear urine drained from the catheter. The wire, inner 
dilator and metallic shaft of the AccuStick sheath were removed, 
and a Amplatz wire was advanced into the renal pelvis. An 8 
___ dilator was used to open the tract over the Amplatz wire. 
This was followed by successful placement of the 8 ___ 
nephrostomy tube with pigtail locked within the renal pelvis of 
the left kidney. Contrast was injected confirming this location. 
The catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk suture and 
StatLock. The catheter was placed to external bag drainage. 
RIGHT: Under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, a right lower 
pole posterior calix was cannulated with a 21-gauge Cook needle 
through which a 0.018 wire was advanced into the renal pelvis. 
The needle was exchanged for AccuStick sheath. The wire was 
removed. Clear urine drained from the catheter. The wire, inner 
dilator and metallic shaft of the AccuStick sheath were removed, 
and a Amplatz wire was advanced into the renal pelvis. An 8 
___ dilator was used to open the tract over the Amplatz wire. 
This was followed by successful placement of the 8 ___ 
nephrostomy tube with pigtail locked within the renal pelvis of 
the right kidney. Contrast was injected confirming this 
location. The catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk 
suture and StatLock. The catheter was placed to external bag 
drainage.
FINDINGS: Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis/hydroureter. 
Obstruction of the bilateral distal third of the ureters 
(complete obstruction on the right, minimal contrast passage 
into bladder on the left). 
There were no immediate complications. 
IMPRESSION: Successful bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies with 
8 ___ 
nephrostomy tubes. 

___ Pelvic MRI without contrast: 
COMPARISON: Outside hospital CT abdomen ___. 
FINDINGS: 
The uterus and cervix are both enlarged and both are markedly 
abnormal in appearance. The cervix has been replaced by 
heterogeneously T2 hyperintense tissue which invades into the 
posterior vaginal fornix (4:24). This measures approximately 9.3 
x 8.6 cm in the axial plane and up to 18 cm in craniocaudal 
dimension. In addition, there is extension into the parametrial 
tissues diffusely (3:21). Several discrete nodules appear 
relatively more T2 hyperintense including several nodules which 
have passed through the mesorectal fascia and are within the 
mesorectal fat (3:21). In addition, there is a small amount of 
tumor which appears to have invaded through the sigmoid wall 
(3:15). An additional nodule displaces the bladder anteriorly, 
although no frank invasion to the bladder wall can be 
appreciated (4:20). The uterus itself is also markedly abnormal 
and based on the T2 and diffusion signal characteristics, there 
is likely frank invasion of the tumor throughout the uterus. 
There is also a 5.9 x 4.7 cm fundal fibroid (3:6). The tumor 
within the uterine body appears to be confined to the uterus. 
  
There is 3.1 x 2.6 cm mass along the left pelvic side wall 
(3:14), identical in signal intensity to the cervical tumor, 
consistent with a lymph node deposit as the small left ovary 
appears adjacent. The left ovary could not well defined on this 
study though is likely between a dilated right tube and fibroid. 
There is a tubular T2 hyperintense structure in the right 
adnexal region measuring approximately 7.1 x 3.5 cm. This 
contains T2 hypointense debris in a dependent distribution. 
Given this appearance, it is most likely reflecting a dilated 
fallopian tube. The urinary bladder and rectum are unremarkable 
in appearance, although as stated before, there are tumor 
deposits extending into the mesorectal fat. 
  
Additional limited in- and out-of-phase T1-weighted images were 
obtained of the upper abdomen to assess the left adrenal mass. 
This mass measures approximately 3.5 x 3 cm and demonstrates 
diffuse loss of signal on out-of-phase compared to in-phase 
T1-weighted images, consistent with an adenoma. The visualized 
osseous structures are unremarkable.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large cervical mass, replacing both the cervix and uterus 
extending into the parametrium, mesorectal fat and likely the 
sigmoid colon focally.  Overall, this mass measures greater than 
18 cm in craniocaudal extent. MRI stage T4 given invasion of the 
sigmoid colon. 
2. Enlarged abnormal lymph node in the left hemipelvis. 
3. Dilated cystic structure in the right adnexa likely 
hydrosalpinx with debris. 
4. Left adrenal adenoma.

___ PET-CT
HEAD/NECK: There is a 7 mm hypoattenuating non FDG avid left 
thyroid lobe nodule. There are no suspicious FDG avid lesions.  
CHEST: There is a non FDG avid 1 cm nodule in the right major 
fissure of the lungs. There are no suspicious FDG avid lesions. 
There is a small pericardial effusion.  
ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Stable left adrenal gland adenoma (non FDG avid 
- SUV 2.2). Redemonstrated is the large about 9.5 x 8.5 cm 
cervical mass with a SUVmax of about 15, with invasion of the 
sigmoid colon and mesorectum (as seen on the previous MRI), with 
a large left 3.1 x 2.5 cm FDG avid external iliac lymph node 
with a SUV max of 14.7 (imag 147). There is a non FDG avid right 
hydrosalpinx.  
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no suspicious FDG avid lesions.  
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary 
glands, GI and GU tracts, liver and spleen. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Large FDG avid cervical mass and pelvic 
lymphadenopathy. 2. 1 cm pulmonary nodule in the right major 
fissure, likely represents benign lymph node. However, attention 
on follow-up studies is recommended. 3. No suspicious FDG avid 
lesions to suggest distant metastatic disease. 

___ Cervical mass biopsy and left vulvar biopsy pathology 
report
I.  Cervix, biopsy (A):
- Squamous cell carcinoma, invasive, moderately differentiated.
- Depth of invasion cannot be assessed.
II.  Vulva, biopsy (B):
High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (Vulvar 
Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3).
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ G7P2 woman with poor medical compliance who 
presented to ___ with two weeks of nausea, vomiting, 
malaise and abdominal pain and was found to have a large pelvic 
mass on CT and ___. She was transferred to ___ where she was 
admitted to the ICU after bilateral nephrostomy tube placement 
by interventional radiology and then transferred to the 
gynecologic oncology service for work-up of her pelvic mass when 
she was medically stabilized. Her hospital course, by problem, 
was as follows:
.
#Acute Kidney Injury:  Based on imaging showing bilateral 
hydronephrosis and hydroureters, the etiology of her ___ was 
largely post-renal from obstruction.  The most important 
intervention was placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes.  She 
quickly had nearly 2 liters of clear urine output after 
placement of nephrostomy tubes. She did not have any urgent 
indication for dialysis and therefore her electrolytes were 
monitored closely q6h for 48 hours with appropriate decrease in 
her potassium and phos. Her creatinine decreased from 18.5 on 
admission to 2.1 on discharge. She received teaching for care of 
her percutaneous nephrostomy tubes prior to discharge, and will 
follow-up with nephrology and urology at ___.
.
#Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in etiology from decreased 
oral intake and emesis prior to admission.  She was given 1L NS 
boluses x 2 and sodium was monitored q6h for development of 
post-diuresis hypernatremia. She was maintained on D5W with 
bicarb to prevent a rapid increase in serum sodium greater than 
10 in 24 hours, according to nephrology recommendations. Her Na 
on admission was 127, and normalized on the afternoon of 
hospital day 2 at which point she was maintained of D5W until 
she was taking PO, at which point she was saline locked.
.
# Cervical mass: CT scan at ___ showed a large mass arising 
from cervix, bilateral moderate hydronephrosis, and a possible 
1cm R lung density. After she was medically stabilized in the 
ICU, she was transferred to the gynecologic oncology service on 
hospital day 1. On hospital day 2, she was taken to the OR for 
an exam under anesthesia, cervical mass biopsy, left posterior 
vulvar biopsy, cystoscopy, and proctoscopy. Intraoperative 
findings were notable for a large cervical mass extending down 
the vagina with parametrial involvement from the sidewall. There 
was no evidence of invasion of the bladder or rectal mucosa. 
Please refer to Dr. ___ report for details of the 
operation. Final pathology is pending at the time of this 
discharge summary. A pelvic MRI confirmed the 18cm cervical mass 
extending in to the parametrium, mesorectal fat, and likely the 
sigmoid colon with enlarged lymph nodes in the left pelvis. A 
PET-CT was performed to evaluate for distant metastasis showed 
""no suspicious FDG avid lesions to suggest distant metastatic 
disease"". Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Her diet 
was advanced on post-operative day 1 with no nausea, pain was 
controlled with percocet, she had good urine output from both 
nephrostomy tubes, and she was ambulating independently without 
difficulty.
.
#Anemia: Unclear baseline Hct for pt, Hct of 25.8 in ED. She was 
hemodynamically stable, without evidence of active hemorrhage. 
Prior to going to the OR on hospital day 2, her HCT decreased to 
23, so she was transfused 2 units pRBCs for stabilization prior 
to cervical biopsy. Her post-transfusion HCT was appropriate at 
32.5. Post-operatively, her cervical bleeding was minimal, and 
her HCT on discharge was stable at 31.
.
#Leukocytosis:  She presented with a leukocytosis of 20.2.  
Differential included complicated urinary tract infection vs. 
malignancy/stress reaction. She received 2 doses of ceftriaxone, 
which was discontinued after urine culture was negative. Blood 
culture were no growth at the time of this discharge summary.
.
#Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely ___ ___ and uremia, 
lactate normal at 1.1.  VBG on admission revealed a pH of 7.31.
.
#Code status: Patient was okay with intubation but was DNR
.
#Soc: She was seen by social work for her new diagnosis, coping, 
and resources.

By hospital day 4/post-operative day 2, her creatinine was 
significantly improved, and her electrolytes were normalized. 
She was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, and 
pain was controlled with percocet. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with plans for outpatient follow-up with 
___ urology, ___ Kidney and Hypertension, ___ 
radiation oncology, and Dr. ___.

IMAGING:
========
CXR (___):
Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.

Echo ___:
Conclusions
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic 
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free 
wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal with borderline normal free wall function. The diameters 
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ of T1DM, ESRD s/p failed kidney transplant (___) and 
pancreas transplant (___) now on PD, HTN, CAD (s/p DES to LCx 
on DAPT in ___, PVD s/p b/l BKA who p/w n/v, elevated glucose, 
anion gap metabolic acidosis c/f DKA.

=================  
ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# Gap Metabolic Acidosis concerning for DKA: Patient had had 
multiple admissions in the past for DKA and a pattern of 
non-compliance. However, patient stated he had been compliant w/ 
insulin at home. There were no recent illnesses or stresses that 
he reported and no recent alcohol use. Upon review of 
medications with ___ Diabetes specialists, however, patient 
stated that he had only been taking novolog and also 
intraperitoneal insulin (i.e. not taking any long-acting 
insulin). On admission, patient had an anion gap metabolic 
acidosis w/ glucose 341 upon arrival that uptrended to 463 in 
the ED before being placed on insulin gtt. Patient was anuric, 
so urine ketones were not checked. Patient was restarted on SC 
insulin upon arrival to ICU floor w/ end therapy for insulin 
being detemir 4U at breakfast and 6U at bedtime, novolog 5U w/ 
meals, novolog sliding scale w/ meals. He also will receive 18U 
of novolin insulin in his PD fluid. ___ clarified his insulin 
regimen prior to discharge. Patient notably had some abdominal 
pain and nausea the day of discharge, but his laboratory work 
was unremarkable except for mild leukocytosis.  

# Hypertensive emergency, type II NSTEMI: Trop was elevated to 
1.47 upon arrival, downtrended subsequently. Patient had a poor 
baseline of known CAD and is s/p DES to ___ in ___. Has ESRD 
but baseline trops 0.4-0.5. EKGs unchanged from prior. Most 
likely demand ischemia I/s/o hypovolemia ___ DKA and/or 
contribution from hypertensive emergency. Cards saw patient in 
ED and said no intervention or heparin gtt at this time. 
Continued home ASA/Plavix, Lipitor 80 and Coreg. Echo 
demonstrated no marked changes from his prior. 

# HTN Urgency/Emergency: Presented w/ sBP in 200s, improved to 
170s in ED. Had a trop leak as above, thought to be possibly 
demand ischemia ___ to hypertension. By the time he arrived to 
the ICU, his BP had normalized. Patient stated he was not able 
to keep PO meds down at home given n/v, hence the elevated BP 
upon arrival. Patient just had one episode of SBP > 180 on the 
day prior to his discharge, though this improved once he took 
his oral home blood pressure meds.

# Anemia: Patient demonstrated a downtrending Hb from prior 
without evidence of hemolysis or bleeding. He did not require 
transfusion. He stated he was due for his Aranesp infusion, 
which was originally to be ___. His peritoneal dialysis team 
including Dr. ___ was contacted for follow-up. On review of 
his CBCs, it was noted that he has had a long-standing anemia 
with some predominance of myeloid precursors. Hematology 
consultation as outpatient is suggested. 

# Hyponatremia: likely pseudohyponatremia given elevated 
glucose. Resolved w/ tx.

# ESRD on PD: s/p failed kidney and pancreas transplant. Renal 
consulted to continue PD in house. Continued home sevalamir, 
nephrocaps, and prednisone. He noted that after peritoneal 
dialysis he had stomach pain and difficulty taking his home 
meds. His outpatient nephrologist was contacted regarding 
management strategies for this, such as leaving in 100cc to 
prevent pain.

=================  
CHRONIC ISSUES  
================= 
# Anemia: at baseline, monitored
# Depression: Continued home celexa and Wellbutrin 
# GERD: continued home PPI
# Gastroparesis: continued home reglan

Transitional issues: 
- patient notably refused ___ on discharge.
- patient has blood and peritoneal cultures that require 
follow-up.
- Patient is being discharged on an insulin regimen of novolog 5 
units at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with 4 units of levemir 
at breakfast and 6 units at dinner. He also injects 18 units of 
novolin into 6L 1.5% peritoneal dialysis bag. He was written for 
new supplies.
- Patient had ongoing presence of anemia on discharge, with Hb 
downtrending from 10 to low 7s this admission. Seemed most 
consistent with downtrend in the setting of inflammation, with 
patient being due for his outpatient Aranesp. On review of his 
CBCs, however, it was noted that he has had a long-standing 
anemia with some predominance of myeloid precursors. Hematology 
consultation as outpatient is suggested. Dr. ___ was 
contacted re: setting up outpatient PD team to provide Aranesp. 
- his abdominal pain mostly occurs toward the end of his PD 
sessions; Nephrology may consider leaving residual fluid to 
reduce the discomfort of the final fluid pull of his PD, as 
suggested by inpatient Nephrology consultation
- Patient had slight leukocytosis on discharge labs. He should 
ideally receive follow-up sets of labs including CBC within one 
week.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the 
hospital.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted due to electrolyte abnormalities, very high 
blood pressure and high blood sugars
- You were seen by the ___ physicians who helped make insulin 
adjustments to control your blood sugar. Please follow both 
their long acting and short acting insulin regimen 
recommendations as prescribed.
- We think your high blood pressures caused some strain on your 
heart, but there is no sign of permanent damage
- We did an extensive evaluation to find a trigger for your 
symptoms, but unfortunately could not find one, so we believe it 
may be related to not taking any long-acting insulin at home

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Please resume your normal PD schedule
- Please follow-up with your usual outpatient providers
- ___ take your insulin injections and peritoneal insulin as 
directed.
- Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

We wish you the best!
- Your ___ Care Team

Head CT: ___:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, 
shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus. The 
gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. The density 
values of brain parenchyma are within normal limits. Imaged 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are pneumatized and well 
aerated. The osseous structures and extra-calvarial soft tissues 
are unremarkable.  
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, no change from 
___.  The study and the report were reviewed by the 
staff radiologist. 

Spine CT ___: 
FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture. The lengths of the 
vertebral bodies 
are preserved. The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital 
relationships are 
maintained. Normal cervical lordosis is exaggerated as on the 
prior studies. The prevertebral soft tissues are normal. Imaged 
lung apices are clear. There is no bony canal stenosis.   
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment 

Hip/pelv XR: ___:
FINDINGS: The pelvis is intact without fracture or dislocation. 
Sacrum and 
sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. Bilateral femoral heads are 
appropriately located. In particular, there is no fracture or 
dislocation involving the proximal right femur. A right femoral 
line is in place.   
IMPRESSION: No traumatic injury to the right hip or pelvis. 

CRX: ___:
FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded and clear. The mediastinum 
is 
unremarkable. There is a well-defined descending thoracic aorta. 
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size. No 
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. There is a deformity 
involving the anterolateral aspect of the right sixth rib 
consistent with interval fracture. Given history, this may be 
acute. It is new since the prior study. The spinal column is 
normal on AP view.   
IMPRESSION: Question age-indeterminate fracture of the lateral 
aspect of the right sixth rib. No pneumothorax noted. 

ABD U/S: ___:
FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates a diffusely increased 
echogenicity 
consistent with fatty infiltration. There are no focal liver or 
liver 
abnormalities detected. The main portal vein is patent with 
appropriate 
hepatopetal flow. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary 
dilatation. 
This is a technically limited study, and the pancreas is not 
well visualized. The spleen measures 10.3 cm and is 
unremarkable. The abdominal aorta was unable to be adequately 
visualized. The left kidney measures 9.1 cm and the right kidney 
measures 9.0 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, 
nephrolithiasis, or discrete masses in the bilateral kidneys. 
There is noted to be a right pleural effusion.   
IMPRESSION: 
1. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Other forms of liver 
disease and more advanced liver disease including significant 
hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.   
2. Technically limited ultrasound.   
3. Right pleural effusion.   
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


ABD XR series: ___:
FOUR VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: A right-sided femoral line has been 
removed. A 
large amount of air is seen throughout the bowel, but no 
unusually dilated 
loop of bowel or unusual gas or fluid collection. There are 
multiple 
phleboliths in the pelvis. Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
Lateral 
decubitus view demonstrates no evidence of free air.   
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or free air.   
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a multiple medical 
problems PMH significant for possible seizure disorder admitted 
for a  fall complicated by hypotension and mental status change 
and found to have a UTI.
.
#Fall: Patient found not to have a fracture.  This was not her 
first fall.  It is unclear if this was related to a seizure or 
not.  She will be seen in ___ clinic.  She was seen by 
___ who thought that she was a high fall risk and recommended 
going to a rehab hospital.  Staff agreed with this assessment 
however patient had a bad expereince at a rehab hospital before 
and refused to go despite our recommendation.  Multiple 
conversations were held with her regarding this but she refused 
to go.  We discharged her home with ___ and home ___ three times 
a week.  

# Hypotension: Uncertain etiology at this time.  Hypotension was 
not fluid responsive, but multiple lactate levels have been 
negative.  Unlikely to be infectious/sepsis.  Likely element of 
autonomic dysfunction.  ___ be related to low cortisol although 
unlikely.  

# Change in Mental Status: Change in mental status may be due to 
polypharmacy, post-ictal confusion, primary CNS, and hepatic 
encephalopathy.  Resolved on its own and patient is back to 
baseline of conversive and oriented times three.  Although she 
does seem to lack insight into her multiple diseases.  
Hepatology did not think that there was a liver etiology for her 
issues.  Her hepatitis serologies came back consistent with Hep 
B vaccinated and nothing else.  Her cerruloplasmin was 
boarderline low at 19 and her alpha 1 antitrypsan was normal.  
It is unclear if she has some unifying diagnosis to explain her 
liver abnormalities, hypothyroidism and seizures.  She did have 
elevated ferritin and some evidence of pituitary dysfunction.  
In future may consider further workup for hemachromatosis.  
.
# UTI: Prelim speciation as E.coli sensitive to bactrim.  
Patient given course of Bactrim.  
.
# Anemia: Hct this AM 28.4.  Patient received 1u PRBC with 
appropriate increase.  
.
# Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease and/or 
malnutrition. Received 10 mg po vitamin K yesterday.  Patient 
started on daily vitamin K.  
.
# Nutritional status: Patient came in with low albumin and found 
to have low albumin.  Nutritional consult obtained and they 
recomended supplementing meals with ensure.  This was done in 
the hospital.  Unlikely patient will continue as an outpatient.  
___ need further nutritional work as outpatient.  
.
# Hypothyroid: Patient with TSH on admission of <0.02 with free 
T4 of 1.5.  T3 found to be low.  Would re-check as outpatient 
when she is in a more stable setting and adjust dose at that 
time.  
.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman admitted with anorexia nervosa and severe
protein-calorie malnutrition. 

#Anorexia nervosa: 
#Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition. 
   Her weight is less than 75% ideal body weight. She was 
orthostatic and hypokalemic on admission, but this has resolved 
with minimal repletion of electrolytes. Phosphorous has been 
totally stable after four days of adequate feedings and 
prophylactic oral supplementation. She was also given 
multivitamin with minerals. 
   She took meals on our eating disorder protocol. She had been 
doing well at first, and ate 100% of her first 8 meals. At the 
end of her hospitalization, she left half a meal, citing 
abdominal pain. Her excuse for failing was quite rational, but 
the nature of our protocol is to accept no excuses. Therefore, 
the recommendation was made to start feeds by NG tube until she 
can re-demonstrate perfect adherence to voluntary feeds. She did 
not assent to this, and it was not clear whether her legal 
guardian had the authority to consent on her behalf for NG tube 
(he suspected he did not have this authority, but our hospital 
lawyer advised us that it is implicit in his guardianship per 
recent case law). She received a bed at ___ prior to 
resolution of this impasse. 
 
#Constipation, abdominal pain: 
  A chronic, ongoing issue. She takes Miralax TID and Colace BID 
at home, although unclear how much of this is appropriate 
treatment of constipation and how much is part of her disorder 
(nonetheless, she has not been noted to be running back and 
forth from the bathroom).

Pertinent Results:
___ CXR :
As compared to prior study, there is interval increase in the 
right pleural fluid and also increase in the subcutaneous air.  
The extent of the intrathoracic air is difficult to assess.  
Also, atelectasis of the right lower lobe is suspected given the 
interval development of the right 
mediastinal shift concerning for right lower lung atelectasis. 
  
___ Chest CT :
1.  Large hydro-hemo-pneumothorax with a chest drain in situ 
which could be repositioned more medially. 
2.  Minimal aeration of the residual right lower lobe lung with 
apparent 
occlusion of the lower lobe bronchus as described.  No definite 
cause for this is identified; however, mucus plugging is 
considered likely.  The adjacent vasculature is normal in 
appearance, rendering torsion unlikely. 
3.  Moderate intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct 
dilatation, no cause seen on this study. 
4.  Hepatic hemangioma. 

___ CXR :
The PA and lateral radiographs on the current study demonstrate 
interval 
improvement of the right lower lung aeration with more central 
than before position of the mediastinum.  Currently, the upper 
margin of the right lower lung is better seen and is located 
approximately 5.5 cm below the apex of the hemithorax.  
Subcutaneous air appears to be unchanged.  Left lung is 
essentially clear. 
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right upper lobe and superior segment RLL, 
Lymph Node Level 9, Lymph Node Level 7, 10R lymph node, 12R 
lymph node, LYMPHNODE LEVEL 4R, LYMPHNODE LEVEL 2, ___ 
BRONCHIAL SOFT TISSUE FINAL MARGIN.

___ CXR :
Successful pigtail drainage catheter removal without evidence of 

increasing pneumothorax and unaltered chest wall emphysema.  
Further followup is recommended. 

Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed 
by 
___ ___. ___ 

DIAGNOSIS:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where she underwent a video-assisted 
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) right upper
lobectomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) right 
lower lobe superior segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node 
dissection and bronchoscopy with lavage. She tolerated the 
procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.  
She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was controlled 
with IV Dilaudid. She had no air leak from her chest tube and 
minimal drainage.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she had some oxygen 
desaturations along with dyspnea and more crepitus over her 
right chest.  Her chest xray showed a slightly larger right 
apical space and her tube was placed on suction with resolution 
of her symptoms. Her pain was controlled with Oxycodone and she 
was able to use her incentive spirometer effectively.  Following 
removal of her chest tube she has a stable right apical space 
but eventually developed a large air fluid level and a pigtail 
catheter was placed on ___.  Subsequently a chest CT was 
done which demonstrated RLL atelectesis with obstruction of the 
RLL bronchus.  After vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest 
___ and increased incentive spirometry, her CXR improved.  On 
___ she underwent a bronchoscopy to assure airway patency 
and had a large mucous plug removed.  The BAL grew Pseudomonas 
and she was placed on a 7 day course of Levaquin as she also had 
some GPC in the initial gram stain.  Her WBC was 13K  but she ws 
afebrile. Her pigtail catheter was removed on ___ after a 
successful clamp trial.  Her surgical sites were healing well.

Following removal of her foley catheter she had some urinary 
retention and was straight cathed for 800 cc's but had no 
trouble thereafter.  Her appetite was modest and she was 
encouraged to take additional protein supplements.

She will need to follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in ___ weeks 
and will also follow up with the Medical Oncologist at the same 
time.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with HCV, EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy 
and ascites, on liver transplant list (MELD 18), and history of 
pulmonary embolism s/p anticoagulation, who presents with 
vomiting x 2 days and dizziness.  
.  
#. Vomiting: The etiology of the patient's vomiting was unclear, 
but was likely related to viral infection. It was non-bloody. 
There was no further vomiting after admission. Blood and urine 
cultures were negative. CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia. 
Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis. The patient did have several insect bites, so he 
was started on empiric doxycycline (planned 7-day course). He 
was also treated empirically with ciprofloxacin (planned 7-day 
course).
.
#. Dehydration: The patient became dehydrated in the setting of 
overdiuresis and vomiting. He was treated with 1 L of normal 
saline and 100 grams of albumin. Diuretics were initially held 
but were restarted at a lower dose prior to discharge. The 
patient was instructed to monitor his weight daily and report 
any change to his doctor. He was also instructed to hold his 
diuretics if he developed vomiting.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with 
creatinine 1.8, up from baseline 1.3. The etiology was thought 
to be prerenal, related to diuresis and vomiting. The patient 
was treated with 1 L of normal saline and 100 grams of albumin. 
Diuretics initially held then restarted at a lower dose. The 
patient's creatinine trended down and was 1.3 at the time of 
discharge.
.
#. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient developed worsened 
hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of dehydration. This 
improved with lactulose. At the time of discharge, the patient's 
mental status had returned to baseline. 
.
#. Headache: The patient had a headache throughout his 
admission. There was no nuchal rigidity. CT head ___ was 
normal. The headaches improved with low-dose acetaminophen (<2 
grams/day).
.
#. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: Continued lactulose and rifaximin. 
Held and then restarted diuretics as above. An ultrasound of the 
abdomen was performed prior to discharge and did not show enough 
ascites to drain.
.
#. Microcytic Anemia. Baseline Hct around 30. Iron studies in 
___ suggestive of iron deficiency. The patient will 
need an outpatient colonoscopy if he has not had one.
.  
#. Thrombocytopenia: Baseline around 60-70. On admission, the 
patient's platelet count was near the patient's baseline. At the 
time of discharge, the patient's platelet count was slightly 
below his baseline. The patient's thrombocytopenia was thought 
to be related to his liver disease.
.
#. Sinus tachycardia: The patient remained tachycardic to 100 to 
110 throughout his admission. The etiology of this was unclear. 
The patient remained hemodynamically stable.
.  
#. Chronic back pain: Continued lidocaine patch.
.

Head CT: 
IMPRESSIONS: 
1. 8-mm subacute right frontal subdural collection, without 
evidence of acute 
bleeding. No area of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. Mild atrophy of left temporal lobe. 
3. Paranasal sinus disease with fluid in the sphenoid sinuses 
likely related 
to intubation.  

Chest CT ___:
IMPRESSIONS: 
1. Left lower lobe consolidation may represent atelectasis, 
infection, or 
aspiration. Small right lower lobe ill-defined nodules also 
suggest 
aspiration. 
2. No traumatic injuries within the torso. No fractures. 
3. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 

CT Spine IMPRESSIONS ___: 
1. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine. 
2. Status post C5 through C7 fixation and laminectomies without 
evidence of hardware complication. 

Head MRI ___:
IMPRESSION: 
No acute infarct seen. Unchanged right frontal subdural. Soft 
tissue changes 
in the left frontal sinus and sphenoid sinus. 

MRI spine ___:
IMPRESSION: 
New enhancement and increased signal in the posterior soft 
tissues with a 1.5- cm fluid collection near the tip of the 
spinous process of T1 could be due to trauma or due to new 
inflammatory changes. Infection should be excluded by clinical 
correlation. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at the 
time of interpretation of the study on ___. No epidural 
abscess or cord compression seen. 

Foot AP/Lat: THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FOOT: There is no fracture 
or dislocation. No focal lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormality 
is visualized. No radiopaque foreign bodies are present. There 
are no soft tissue calcifications. No focal lytic or sclerotic 
osseous abnormalities are present. Joint spaces are relatively 
preserved. 
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation. 
  

Chest X ray ___:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with 
patient in 
sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next 
previous 
similar study obtained 14 hours earlier during the same date. 
Position of NG tube and left-sided subclavian central venous 
line unchanged as described earlier. Inspiration status markedly 
improved. The left-sided retrocardiac diffuse density seen on 
the previous study has now cleared up. One can identify a plate 
atelectasis, but as the left-sided diaphragm is well described, 
significant pleural effusion and parenchymal infiltrate in this 
area is most unlikely. No pneumothorax has developed. Pulmonary 
vasculature is not congested. 
IMPRESSION: Improvement of previously identified left lower lobe 
atelectasis in patient with suspected overdose and previous 
respiratory failure. 

EMG ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings can be 
explained most parsimoniously by a severe, subacute (between 3 
weeks to 3 months) C7-T1 polyradiculopathy on the right. The 
findings cannot be explained by a 
posterior interosseous neuropathy in isolation. The preservation 
of the medial antebrachial cutaneous response on the right makes 
a brachial plexopathy effecting the lower trunk unlikely. There 
is also evidence for an underlying, mild, chronic C5-7 
radiculopathy on the right. Of note, axonal continuity is 
maintained to all muscles tested. If clinically indicated, 
repeat testing in three months may be warranted. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M found down at home, intubated in ED for unresponsiveness 
after coumadin and lamictal overdose
.  
# Unresponsiveness /Fall: In the ED, vital signs were initially 
were 99 146/89 HR 86 RR 16 100% The patient was intubated. He 
had CT Head which showed right frontal lobe area concerning for 
a subdural hematoma. Neurosurgery felt that the CT head changes 
were related to post surgical status, and no acute intervention 
was needed. CT Torso showed LLL infiltrate concerning for 
aspiratin pneumonia; thus pt given Vanc/zosyn. Xray of right 
foot done for swelling noted on exam which was negative for 
fracture. Labs remarkable for ABG 7.40/44/324, INR 1.7, lactate 
2.4, WBC 12.4, trop <0.01, creatinine 0.8. EKG with TWI and ST 
depression v4-v6 that resolved on repeat.  The patient was 
admitted to the MICU where the intitial differential also 
included lamictal and coumadin overdose, seizure vs ETOH 
Withdrawal vs arrhythmia (given the EKG changes noted in ED that 
later resolved) vs PE (the patient was subtherapeutic on 
coumadin on arrival) vs Wernickes encephalopathy. 

On arrival to the MICU he was responding to commands with 
lightened sedation but with clonus and hyperreflexia (not 
thought to be new but possibly be more pronounced than 
previously described on OMR notes).  While he was being examined 
by the MICU team off propofol, he started having rhythmic jerky 
movements in all limbs, and neuro was called for concerns of 
seizures. They noted that the patient was able to stop the 
movement for few secs if instructed and was able to follow 
commands during these movements. It was thought that the patient 
was exhibiting clonus due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy due 
to multi medication overdose (lamictal and coumadin) or 
withdrawal (alcohol vs benzodiazepines).  
.  
When the patient was awake to be able to give a history it was 
determined that the patient has a history of alcohol abuse with 
DTs in the past. However, he stated he has not had alcohol in 
over a month. The patien's sister corroborated this story 
telling the neurology team that the patient was in a supervised 
setting post op in his father's home with sister's assistance 
and no alcohol available. She did, however, think that he used 
his anti-anxiety and narcotics Rx at an ""accelerated rate"" and 
overdosed in part due to despondence over pain/restrictive 
environment. He is normally prescribed 1.5 mg ativan a day.  In 
light of this information, it was thought that the patient might 
be exhibiting withdrawal not from alcohol but from 
benzodiazepines so he was started on a CIWA scale with valium. 
His mental status improved considerably with this regimen.  
  
The patient was also evaluated by psychiatry who did not elicit 
suicidal ideation. The patient told the team that he took ___ 
pills of Warfarin w/Lamotrigine because he ""wanted to go to 
sleep."" However, in talking with the patient's father, he stated 
that he feels that his son is not safe to go home and may 
actually be a danger to himself. Therefore, psych determined 
that the patient should be ___ with a 1:1 sitter.  

The pateint was deemed stable for the medicine floor and was 
transferred.  There he continued to improve, with no 
disorientation.  He was alert with good concentration.  He was 
maintained on CIWA scale but only required 2 doses of diazepam 
for anxiety.  He did not score above 10 on the CIWA scale.  He 
was maintained on telemetry and had a few episodes of 
tachycardia to the 150s which was thought to be normal sinus 
rhythm.  Because this only happened when he was getting up from 
bed and walking it was thought that he was orthostatic and 
deconditioned from lying in bed for so long.  He was hydrated 
with IV fluids and orthostatics were checked and were negative.  
He was encouraged to walk around 3 times a day each day.

# Suicide attempt:  As stated above the patient denied suicide 
attempt with the overdose, but rather states he was just trying 
to make himself go to sleep by taking all of the medications.  
He was evaluated by psych who also talked to the patient's 
father who thought  the patient would be a danger to himself at 
home.  For this reason and the fact that the patient has prior 
suicide attempts he was made ___ and kept a 1:1 sitter.  
His fluoxetine was restarted at 60 mg a day on ___ but no 
other psychiatric medications were restarted.  TSH was checked 
and was normal at 3.1.  The patient was discharged to an 
___ facility.  
.  
# Subderual hematoma/hygroma: The patient has a chronic right 
frontal hygroma and was evaluated by neurosurgery who felt that 
this was resolving and no intervention was needed.  They also 
felt that there was no contraindication to coumadin. Per 
neurosurgery, the patient will need a follow-up head CT as an 
outpatient in 4 weeks (end of ___.  He should call  
___ to book this appointment.  He 
should follow up with neurosurgery after he gets this CT.  He 
can call the following number to schedule this appointment: 
___.
.  
# Pulmonary infiltrate: CT chest showed evidence of aspiration 
PNA. The patient was afebrile but initially had a mild 
leukocytosis so he was given vanc/Zosyn for 3 days.  Antibiotics 
were stopped because the patient was not exhibiting symptoms and 
was afebrile.  He continued to not have any symptoms of 
pneumonia including shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, or 
fever.
.  
# DVT's: The patient had bilateral lower extremity DVTs 
diagnosed at a recent admission, for which he was discharged on 
coumdain.  After his overdose on coumadin he was given 10 mg IV 
vitamin K at the OSH.  During this hospitalization his initial 
INR was 1.7 so his coumadin was held.  His INR trended down to 
1.0.  Neurosurgery felt that it was ok to restart his coumadin 
so the patient was bridged with lovenox BID.   His INR remained 
at 1.0 for several days so his coumadin dose was increased to 10 
mg for two days before titrating back to 4 mg a day.  The day of 
discharge his INR was 1.4. The patient should continue to get 4 
mg (his home dose) coumadin and have his INR checked every day 
until he is theraputic (INR ___.  At that time he can 
discontinue the lovenox injections.
.
# right hand palsy:  The patient was noted to have a right hand 
palsy where he was unable to extend his right fingers.  It was 
recommenced by Dr. ___ neurosurgeon, that he get an EMG 
study.  The findings of this study were: ""Complex, abnormal 
study. The electrophysiologic findings can be explained most 
parsimoniously by a severe, subacute (between 3 weeks to 3 
months) C7-T1 
polyradiculopathy on the right. The findings cannot be explained 
by a 
posterior interosseous neuropathy in isolation.""  Neurology 
recommended that the patient follow up with Dr. ___ 
___. and have a repeat EMG in three months.  The patient can call 
___ to schedule the follow up appointment and ___ to schedule the EMG study.  The patient was evaluated 
by Occupational Therapy who priovided a daytime and a nighttime 
splint which he should continue to wear.  The patient noted 
subjective improvement of his wrist extension, but no 
improvement of his finger extension the day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital after you were found down on the 
ground.  You told us that you overdosed on Lamictal and 
Coumadin.  You were intubated and monitored in the intensive 
care unit.  We gave you medicines to treat you for 
benzodiazepine withdrawal and supportive measures until the 
medications you overdosed on cleared from your system.  You were 
evaluated by the neurosurgeons who thought that your head did 
not have evidence of bleeding.  They would like you to follow up 
with a repeat head CT in 4 weeks and see them in outpatient 
clinic.  You can call to schedule these appointments (see 
below).

You were also evaluated by the psychiatrists who thought that 
you might be in danger of hurting yourself.  They think you 
would benefit from inpatient psychiatric treatment.  Please 
follow their recommendations regarding restarting your 
medications for depression, some of which we have held during 
this hospitalization.

You were also noted to have a right hand paralysis that you 
first noticed after your initial fall back in ___.  You had 
an EMG study performed which showed some abnormailities in the 
nerves in your arm.  The neurologists would like you to follow 
up with them and have a repeat EMG in 3 months.  Please see 
below for the numbers to call to schedule these appointments.  
You were also seen by occupational therapy who stated you should 
wear a resting splint when you sleep as well as a dyamic brace 
during the day when you are doing activities.  

We restarted you back on your blood thinners for your blood clot 
in your legs.  You should continue to take both the lovenox 
shots twice a day as well as the coumadin once a day and have 
your blood drawn every day until your INR level is theraputic 
(between 2 and 3).  At that time you can stop the lovenox shots 
and just continue with the coumadin.

Pleas note the following changes to your medications:
Please Stop Lamictal
Please Stop Fluoxetine
Please change your oxycodone to 10 mg every 4 hours as needed 
for arm, neck, shoulder pain
Please continue lovenox 60 mg twice a day until your INR is 
between 2 and 3.

Please continue to take the rest of your medications as 
prescribed.

It was a pleasure taking part in your care.

Chief Complaint:
disequlibrium and L leg heaviness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
na
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old man with a history of HTN, HLD,
NSTEMI, pre-DM, depression, presenting with an episode of
disequlibrium and L leg heaviness which is now resolved.

The patient was in his normal state of health until 4 AM when he
woke up to go to the bathroom (which he commonly does several
times per night). Lying in bed after waking up he experienced a
rocking type sensation of movement. When he stood up he felt 
very
unsteady and off balance. Denied frank vertigo or presyncope. He
had to hold onto the walls and the furniture while walking to 
the
bathroom, and held onto the sink to sit down onto the toilet. He
felt nausous but did not vomit. He used the bathroom and was 
able
to walk back to bed with difficulty and went back to sleep. He
woke up again around 9 AM and went downstairs for breakfast.
Walking down the stairs, he noted a feeling of heaviness in his 
L
leg. He did not trip or fall or notice frank weakness, but did
have this sensation of heaviness. He still had some persistant
disequlibrium (had to hold onto the railing for support) and
nausea but this was not as severe as previously. He got
downstairs and took a sip of tea but was not hungry enough to 
eat
more breakfast. He told his family he was feelign off and his
brother (a doctor) came over to check him out, taking an EKG and
vitals signs, and recommended he go to the ED. He did not feel
well enough to drive himself so his daughter drove him to the ED
around 11:30. His symptoms continued to improve during this time
and by the time of my evaluation (3:30 ___ these were completely
resolved. 

The patient has had some achy posterior L shoulder pain several
inches below the base of his L neck, just above his scapula. 
This
is an achy nagging pain. No injury to his neck or shoulder
recently or atypical physical activity is reported.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ yo man with a history of HTN, HLD, NSTEMI, 
pre-DM and depression who presented with disequlibrium and L leg 
heaviness which resolved by the time of neurologic evaluation. 
Neuro exam was notable for subtle left side clumsiness in upper 
and lower extr and mild left sided dysmetria. MRI is without 
evidence of infarct. CTA head and neck with ~40% stenosis at the 
origin of the left vertebral artery. Given that his exam is 
still subtly abnormal this is most likely an MRI negative 
stroke, cerebellar vs brainstem. Given multiple stroke risk 
factors we will assume this is a stroke. We have increased his 
aspirin to 325mg daily. No other changes were made. He had a 
recent ECHO so this was not repeated. Cause of his stroke may 
have been related to his stenosis of the vertebral artery vs 
small vessel disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of disequlibrium and left 
leg heaviness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
pre-diabetes 
high cholesterol 

We are changing your medications as follows:
increasing your aspirin to 325mg daily 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital because you had several episodes where 
you fell out of bed and woke up on the floor, as well as another 
event when you fell over at home during the day. Although we 
cannot be sure what happened, because no one saw them, these 
kinds of episodes are concerning for seizures.

While you were here, we monitored your brain waves on EEG. We 
saw that there is electrical activity in your brain which can be 
associated with seizures. The EEG is a measure of your brain 
waves now and gives us a picture of what your brain activity is 
like normally. It does not tell us exactly what happened in the 
past. However, given the combination of your description of the 
events, and the epileptiform discharges on your EEG, we think 
that it is very likely that you had seizures at the times that 
you fell out of bed.

We recommend that you start a medication to decrease your risk 
of seizure. We would like for you to take Keppra 
(levetiracetam). This medication is a very benign medication. 
Sometimes people find that it causes them to be more irritable 
or to have more mood swings. If you are having this problem we 
recommend that you continue taking the medication and we will 
think about switching it at your follow up appointment.

We have given you a lidocaine patch for your shoulder to help 
with the pain. We recommend rest, heat or ice, an 
anti-inflammatory medication and gentle stretching to help the 
bruise heal.

In the ___, the law is that you should not 
drive for six months following any loss of consciousness. If you 
have another loss of consciousness (passing out, seizure), the 
clock will restart and you will need to wait another six months. 
In addition, we recommend not bathing or swimming alone, as 
there is a risk of drowning if a seizure occurs. Avoid hazardous 
situations should a seizure occur, such as tree climbing or 
bicycling on the street with traffic.

There are some things that can trigger seizures. This includes 
sleep deprivation, alcohol use, illness (particularly nausea and 
vomiting where you cannot tolerate your medications) or missing 
medications. 

Please talk with your neurologist if you intend to become 
pregnant to discuss the management of your seizure medications 
as well as any headache medications you may take in the future.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

- Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ M with history of stage IV pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma with significant lung involvement/lymphangitic 
spread, DVT on Lovenox and SIADH who was admitted due to 
difficulty weaning off the ventilator following port placement. 

# Dyspnea, hypoxia and cough: Patient had cough and hypoxia to 
high ___ on room air. Recent CXR and CT scan are 
suggestive of extensive pulmonary metastases and likely 
lymphangitic spread, which are likely etiology of patient's 
cough. No fever or sputum production to suggest pneumonia, and 
CT shortly prior to admission was without evidence of pneumonia. 
There was likely also an element of atelectasis following 
anesthesia contributing to increased hypoxia. Pt does has hx of 
DVT, but is on anticoagulation with Lovenox, so PE was not 
considered likely. x2. Patient was given ipratropium, albuterol 
nebs, continued on benzonatate and incentive spirometry with 
rapid improvement in his symptoms.

# Stage IV pancreatic cancer: s/p port placement for anticipated 
start of chemotherapy next week.

# Leukocytosis: Likely stress response in setting of significant 
cancer burden and possibly aspiration during procedure. No 
fevers or evidence of pneumonia. 

# Tachycardia: Likely secondary to fluid depletion in setting of 
being NPO for surgery, and responded to IVF.  PE was in ddx as 
above, but patient has been anticoagulated. EKG showed frequent 
PVCs and non-specific ST changes. Troponins were negative.

# Hyponatremia: Likely secondary to SIADH. Na 130 at discharge.

# Hx of DVT/PE: Continued on  lovenox

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Recheck Na at ___ Oncology appt to ensure hyponatremia is 
stable.

History of Present Illness:
___ male with OSA and DJD, who presents to ED with new 
onset AFib with RVR, dyspnea and lower extremity swelling, found 
to have diffuse bilateral PEs. 

Patient has been experiencing dyspnea on exertion lower 
extremity swelling for the past week and also c/o orthopnea 
where he needs to sleep on ___ pillows. He does admit to 
hemoptysis with pink tinged sputum (non purulent) a/w cough for 
the past two days and admits to right sided pleuritic chest pain 
when he has a severe episode of coughing.  

Two weeks ago had hayfever which resolved with cetirizine and 
fluticasone nasal spray. At that time pt was not febrile but c/o 
cough, rhinorrhea, itching around the eyes and increased 
lacrimation.

He denies any chest pain or palpitations. No fevers or chills; 
no recent surgery, travel, immobility. Has been up to date with 
healthcare maintenance (colonoscopies).

Pt had trouble sleeping night before admission due to severe 
dyspnea while lying supine with ___ pillows. and went to PCP the 
next day who found pt to be in Afib and was sent here with HR to 
160s.

In ED, pt was given Lasix 40mg IV, metoprolol IV 5mg x 3, PO 
12.5mg, and dilt 10mg IV x2 which brought HR to 110s-120s. SBP 
initially 147/97, and SBP trended down to 96-105 after given 
nodal blockers. CTA was done which showed PEs and pt started on 
heparin gtt.

==================================================

PATHOLOGY:

___: Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Rare 
degenerated mesothelial cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and 
macrophages.

==================================================

IMAGING:

ECG ___: 
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Left 
ventricular hypertrophy with diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ rapid atrial 
fibrillation is new. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are also 
new. 

CXR ___: 
Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  
Additional bibasilar opacities, particularly at the right 
mid-to-lower lung may be due to infection and/or aspiration. 

CTA ___: 
1.  Bilateral lobar pulmonary emboli with CT findings concerning 
for developing right heart strain, which can be further 
evaluated with echocardiography. 
2.  Consolidation in the right lower lobe, which may be due to 
infarct, though aspiration and infection are also within the 
differential. 
3.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions, right greater than 
left. 

___ ___: 
No DVT of the bilateral lower extremity.  There is occlusive 
thrombus within the left greater saphenous vein.

ECHO ___: 
The left atrium is mildly dilated and elongated. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is moderately-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). 
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate 
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate-severe biventricular 
systolic dysfunction. Right ventricular dilatation.

CT ABD/PELVIS ___:
1.  No CT evidence of malignancy or adenopathy.  
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with 
bibasilar 
collapse. 
3.  Consolidation in the right lower lobe, which may be related 
to infarct, aspiration, or infection.   
4.  Mild nonspecific rectal wall thickening. 

CXR ___: 
Compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase 
in extent of the known right pleural effusion.  The effusion now 
occupies approximately ___ of the right hemithorax.  It must be 
assumed, that the parenchymal opacity at the right lung bases, 
present on the chest x-ray from ___ and better 
documented on the CT examination of the chest from ___, is still present. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  Left 
lung is normal.  There is no left pleural effusion.  A mild 
retrocardiac atelectasis is seen as a sole abnormality. 

ECHO ___: 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated. 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___ secondary 
to moderate global hypokinesis with severe hypokinesis of the 
interventricular septum . The right ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There 
is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the patient appears less tachycardic and image quality has 
improved. Left ventricular systolic function remains severely 
depressed. Right ventricular may have improved slightly but 
suboptimal image quality of the prior study precludes definite 
comparison. Pulmonary pressures are lower.  

CXR ___: 
Current study demonstrates substantial amount of pleural 
effusion and large pneumothorax on the right with persistent 
left mediastinal shift consistent with substantial amount of 
still present air and fluid on the right.  Subsequent 
radiographs demonstrated insertion of the chest tube. 
The right chest tube has been placed.  There is no substantial 
pleural effusion demonstrated.  There is minimal reexpansion 
pulmonary edema seen.  There is minimal amount of apical 
pneumothorax present. 

Right Heart Cath ___: 
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling 
pressures with an RVEDP of 11 mm Hg.  There was also pulmonary 
arterial hypertension with PA pressure of 43/26 mm Hg.  Left 
sided filling pressures were minimally elevated with a PCWP mean 
pressure of 16 mm Hg. The cardiac index was depressed at 1.38 
l/min/m2 using an assumed oxygen consumption. Dopamine was 
turned down at 1222 after initial vascular access given ongoing 
tachycardia to heart rates in the 150s.  Values above are 
reported on low dose dopamine (0.5 mcg/kg/min).  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension on low dose dopamine 
2. Mild elevation of PCW on low dose dopamine 
3. Low computed cardiac index on low dose dopamine 
4. Ongoing tachycardia 

CXR ___: 
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube is 
inunchanged position.  There is, however, a small basal lateral 
remaining pneumothorax. Unchanged right basal areas of 
atelectasis, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged absence 
of larger pleural effusions.

ECHO ___: 
No intracardiac thrombus. Severe dilation of the pulmonary 
artery. Severely dilated RV with global free wall hypokinesis 
and ___'s sign.

CXR ___: 
Right upper pleural tube unchanged in position.  Small right 
pneumothorax is predominantly lateral and inferior.  Tube 
function should be evaluated to see if it is fissural.  
Consolidation in the right lower lung has been stable since 
thoracentesis.  Whether this is re-expansion edema, residual 
atelectasis, or primary pulmonary pathology is radiographically 
indeterminate at this stage.  Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.  
No pulmonary edema. 
 
CXR ___: 
Right chest tube remains in place.  A loculated hyperlucency is 
seen in the right lateral lower thorax which could reflect a 
loculated pneumothorax.  There is improving aeration at the 
right base with residual patchy opacity which likely reflects 
resolving atelectasis or edema related to re-expansion.  There 
is a residual small right effusion.  Left lung is grossly clear. 
 No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours 
are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. 

CXR ___: 
Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent 
apparent loculated hydropneumothorax at the right lung base.  
Improving atelectasis in right middle and right lower lobes.  
Apparently new small left pleural effusion with adjacent 
atelectasis. Otherwise, no relevant short interval 
changes. 
 
___: CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  
1.  Interval thoracentesis with chest tube placement in a prior 
right pleural effusion. The overall size of the effusion has 
decreased; however, there are three focal loculated pockets of 
residual pleural fluid.  A pocket along the major fissure 
contains a small amount of air and fluid, a small 
hydropneumothorax. 
2. Small right anterior pneumothorax. 
3. Decreased size of a left pleural effusion, now small. 
4. Persistent right lower lobe consolidation, likely ongoing 
atelectasis in the setting of prior large effusion. 
5. Prior right lower lobe ground-glass opacity has resolved, 
likely the site of prior infarct in the setting of known 
pulmonary emboli. 
6. Unchanged dilatation of the main pulmonary artery up to 4.2 
cm. 
7. Heterogeneous left lobe of the thyroid gland with probable 
focal nodule.Recommend non-emergent ultrasound for further 
characterization. 

___ ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global 
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] Tricuspid regurgitation is 
present but cannot be quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with global biventricular hypokinesis. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared with the 
prior study (images reviewed) of ___, right ventricular 
cavity size is smaller and biventricular systolic function is 
improved. Mild aortic regurgitation is now identified.  

___.Right pleural drain removed. New large right hemothorax and 
right chest wall hematoma along prior chest tube tract. Small 
anterior right 
hydropneumothorax unchanged.  
2.Possible right basal traumatic pneumatocele. 
3.Probable pulmonary hypertension reflected in stable dilatation 
of the main pulmonary artery. 
4.Severe, increased right lower lobe atelectasis, right lung 
otherwise, and left lung both clear. Small non-hemorrhagic left 
pleural effusion and 
associated minimal compressive atelectasis both unchanged. 
  
___ CXR: 
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the chest 
tubes remain in place.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There may 
still be a tiny amount of gas loculated in the right 
costophrenic angle. 
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Left 
lung is 
essentially clear with mild atelectatic changes at the base. 

___ CXR: 
Moderate cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.  
Left lower lobe opacities have increased, consistent with 
increasing atelectasis and small effusion.  Right lower lobe 
atelectasis is stable.  There are no large pneumothoraces.  
Three right chest tubes remain in unchanged position.  Right 
PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  Right chest wall subcutaneous 
emphysema is seen. 

___ CXR: 
In comparison with study of ___, the right chest tubes remain 
in place and there is no evidence of substantial pneumothorax.  
Continued opacification at the right base consistent with recent 
surgery.  Left base appears somewhat clear, though there is 
again evidence of pleural fluid and atelectasis. Small amount of 
right subcutaneous emphysema is again seen.
 
___ CXR:
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right 
chest tubes have been removed.  There may be a tiny apical 
pneumothorax.  Continued decrease opacification at the right 
base with continued subcutaneous gas along the right lateral 
chest wall extending into the neck and abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with obesity and OSA on CPAP who 
was admitted to the CCU with new-onset segmental PEs, AFib/RVR, 
and new biventricular heart failure.  He was treated for his PEs 
with anticoagulation, and CHF/AFib with diuresis, Milrinone, 
cardioversion, and Amiodarone.  His course was complicated by 
___ and ___ hemothorax which required multiple interventions.  
After 2 weeks in the CCU he was transferred to the Cardiology 
floor and was eventually discharged to ___. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
#. Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: EF 30%-->increased to 45%. 
Still edematous but much improved. No prior diagnosis of CHF, 
though had in past but now with CHF symptoms. Etiology still not 
___ clear, but likely a combination of obesity/OSA, 
hypertension, possibly CAD if it worsened since cardiac cath in 
___, and pulmonary emboli.  Unclear how long he was tachycardic 
but he could have developed tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy 
as well.  He has intermittently been diuresed and was on 
Milrinone for a few days. His weight at discharge is 203 pounds 
and this should be considered his dry weight. Torsemide 40 mg 
and lisinopril 2.5mg held ___ for rising creatinine but this 
should be restarted once creatinine is falling. 

#. Cardiac function: Evidence of both left-sided and right-sided 
dysfunction on echo. Acute decompensation likely secondary to 
PE, with afib with RVR contributing. Initially held off on 
aggressive diuresis given likely pre-load dependence. Patient 
was carefully diuresed with IV lasix PRN as patient grossly 
fluid overloaded on exam. This was a slow process due to 
hemothorax (see below). When hemodynamically stable, patient was 
started on metoprolol XL.

# AFib/RVR: He has much more favorable hemodynamics when he is 
in sinus so he was started on Amiodarone, had a TEE (which 
showed no thrombi) and then was cardioverted ___ (which worked 
for 1 day and he went back into AFib).  ___ he had marginal 
blood pressures and was requiring pressors so he was 
cardioverted again.  Now, in sinus, he is doing much better and 
was weaned off pressors. He was maintained on PO amiodarone. 
When hemodynamically stable, patient was started on metoprolol. 
His amiodarone should be decreased to 200 mg daily in 3 days.    


# Pleural effusions: We believed his effusions were contributing 
to his respiratory status so he underwent thoracentesis ___, 
which was complicated by pneumothorax, now s/p chest tube 
placement and removal ___ (exudative effusion, nothing growing 
out of fluids so far, cytology normal).  Based on CT ___ he 
had large hematoma and hemothorax so went for VATS that day (see 
below). 

# ___: baseline Cr 1, on admission was 1.2, peaked at 2.5, went 
down to 1.6 (Nephrology believes this was mostly from 
contrast-induced nephropathy and also CHF). But after 
hypotension on ___, Cr bumped to 2.2 but slowly dropped back 
down to 1.2. On day of discharge, creatinine increased to 2.2 He 
was found to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and 
flomax started. This could be the cause of increased creatinine. 
Torsemide is on hold. Please perform voiding trial in 5 days and 
check Chem-7 on the day after discharge. 

# Leukocytosis to peak of 55: Hematology believes this is mostly 
reactive, but we had him on empiric antibiotics for HCAP 
coverage. Beta 2 microglobulin and kappa/lamda were mildly 
elevated but again thought to be reactive. BCR-ABL was negtaive. 
JAK 2 was negative.   With time the leukocytosis continued with 
no clear infection so Abx were stopped ___. ___ trending down 
since antibiotics were discontinued. At discharge, WBC was 23.

# Pulmonary emboli: Hematology recommended outpatient 
hypercoagulability work-up and malignancy work-up including 
colonoscopy and biopsies of rectal thickening that was seen on 
CT (you had already referred him back for colonoscopy in ___ 
but they feel he should have a repeat study). Patient maintained 
on heparin drip until it was discovered that he had a large 
hemothorax, at which point heparin drip was stopped (see below). 
Because heparin was off for several days, IVC filter was placed 
on ___ and retrieved on ___ ___onfirmed no further 
increase in the size of the hematoma.

# Hemothorax: Chest CT on ___ showed large hemothorax with 
hematoma tracking along the right chest wall. Patient required a 
total of 4 units red cells to maintain Hct > 21.  Given the 
loculation and large hematoma seen on imaging, patient was taken 
to the OR afternoon of ___ by thoracic surgery for removal of 
hematoma and placement of 3 chest tubes. He tolerated the 
procedure well without complication. Patient's heparin drip (for 
pulmonary embolism, see above) was stopped prior to going to the 
OR. Chest tubes were removed on ___ without 
complications and hematocrit remained stable. 
 
#Erythrocytosis: Pt without history of high H/H. Pt may be dry 
or physiologic compensation for hypoxia (secondary 
polycythemia). CBC trended and dropped to a low of 21.7 in the 
setting of hemothorax (see above). At discharge H/H was 
9.2/29.0. 

# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Multifactorial: Large PEs, PNA, 
pulm infarct, pleural effusion and pulm edema ___ LV 
dysfunction; improved with diuresis and thoracentesis c/b 
pneumothorax. Likely from markedly elevated filing pressures as 
well as possibly an element of compressive atelectasis due to 
the effusion. Now he is more comfortable, satting well on room 
air.

Chronic issues: 
#OA/DJD: Chronic, takes Aleve and Tylenol at home. Tylenol PRN 
for pain control in house.

#OSA: Uses CPAP at home. Patient's wife brought home CPAP in and 
overnight CPAP was continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Consider hypercoagulability workup: for patient that is taking 
anticoagulant, consider acute thrombophilia test profile: APCR, 
fasting homocysteine (level 17.1, ___, lupus anticoagulant, 
Anticardiolipin antibodies IgG and IgM, Prothrombin ___ 
mutation assay; however, this may not be needed as patient was 
fairly immobile prior to developing PE and also likely needs 
lifelong anticoagulation and many of these tests would require 
patient to be off anticoagulation
-Needs anticoagulation for at least 3 months
-Incidental thyroid nodule found on ??, will need outpatient U/S 
to further evaluate

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were admitted with a new abnormal heart rhythm and 
leg swelling and were found to have clots in your lungs. You 
also had some fluid outside of your lungs which was drained. 
Some air escaped from your lung during the procedure and a chest 
tube was placed to help the lung re-expand. You had bleeding at 
the site of the chest tube which was evaluated by thoracic 
surgery. Because the amount of blood collected outside your lung 
was too large to drain, you were taken to the operating room for 
removal of this blood collection and three separate chest tubes 
were placed. You improved and the tubes were removed. You also 
underwent cardioversion for treatment of your abnormal heart 
rhythm and remained in normal rhythm following medication with 
amiodarone. Your heart failure was exacerbated by your abnormal 
rhythm and the pulmonary emboli. You were treated with diuretics 
to remove extra fluid and medications were used to maintain your 
blood pressure when it dropped too low. You were seen by 
hematology/oncology for your elevated white blood cell count and 
your studies were all normal, indicating that the high white 
blood cell count was likely a reaction to stress and or 
infection. Please attend all follow up appointments as indicated 
and take all medications as prescribed.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes 
up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounsd in 3 days.
